# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

## [Unreleased]

- **Pi 1.0.2 (#76).** The server and session daemon run on Pi SDK 1.0.2 instead of 0.99.2, matching current Pi installations and extensions built for Pi 1.0. No session, settings or model data migration is needed.
- **Git identity profiles removed.** PiChamber no longer manages commit-author profiles: the profiles settings UI, the clone-time identity picker, and the silent default auto-apply are gone, along with the server profile storage, credential discovery, and the config-writing routes. Commits, pushes, and clones now use solely the user's own git configuration and credentials. The Git header shows a read-only `Committing as Name <email>` line resolved from git config, which PiChamber never writes. Any previously saved profiles file and any git config previously written into repositories are left untouched; set authorship with plain git (`git config user.email …`).

## [1.0.3] - 2026-09-21

Manual provider models, mobile composer hardening, and worktree recovery since 1.0.2.

- **Allow manual model adding on existing providers (#154).** New `POST /api/pi/providers/:providerId/models` validates id, name, reasoning, thinking level map, input, context and max tokens, then forwards one atomic `providers.models.add` daemon request with structured error mapping. The Providers page adds `AddProviderModelDialog` with shared `CustomProviderModelFields` and `ThinkingLevelsInput`, plus edge case validation for append and duplicate models (`routes`, `model-config-store`, `session-daemon`, `AddProviderModelDialog`, `add-provider-model`, `custom-provider-form`).
- **Mobile attachment picker and worktree handoff (#148, #149).** The composer replaces `MobileAttachmentSheet` with a shared picker input owning the `multiple` plus `accept` contract, gated by one authoritative composer disabled flag across footer triggers, drag overlay, and file selection. Attachments survive worktree sends through centralized snapshots and queued handoff state, with expired refresh coverage (`ChatInput`, `ComposerAttachmentControls`, `ComposerFooter`, `ComposerAttachmentPickerInput`, `attachmentInputProps`, `attachment-snapshots`, `worktreeAttachments`).
- **Leading slash command catalog on mobile (#151).** Slash autocomplete now triggers only on a leading slash. The inline skill autocomplete and its wiring are removed in favor of a compact one line per command mobile list backed by shared `filterAndSortCommands`, with tap versus scroll guards, listbox semantics, and assistive tech exposure for the selected command (`triggers`, `CommandAutocomplete`, `commandAutocompleteItems`, `commandComboboxAria`, `ComposerAutocompletePopups`).
- **Failed worktree sends stay recoverable.** Failed worktree creation keeps its prompt, attachments, and error in the store, restores drafts from the background tasks menu, and retains recovery through prompt settlement instead of dropping the attempt (`useWorktreeCreationStore`, `useWorktreeCreationFailedSend`, `worktreeFailedSend`, `BackgroundTasksMenu`, `WorktreeCreationToasts`).
- **Sessions survive failed first input.** A rejected first prompt no longer deletes the session. Durability cleanup is serialized so one holder retries once, recycle disposal coordinates with session open, cancelled leases hand off to delete and stop drains, and failed create disposal is retained and retried (`session-daemon`, `session-persistence-gap`, `session-failed-create-cleanup`).
- **Worktree session load no longer falls back to stale state (#150).** Unpersisted sessions expire cleanly, stale missing session lookups are rejected, and archived session fallbacks are removed so a failed lookup opens a current project without carrying the unverified id (`pi-session-store`, `useQueuedMessageAutoSend`).
- **Last turn diffs respect explicit opens (#153).** Explicitly opened last turn diffs render, and visible diffs sync from committed expansion state (`useDiffViewState`, `useBranchAndTurnDiffs`, `useDiffScrollManager`).
- **Mobile reconnect indicator refined (#155).** Native mobile keeps its saved endpoint, cached sessions, and drafts during an outage with a quieter reconnect signal (`MobileApp`).
- **Release publishing and updater assets hardened.** Desktop assets stage before publish and upload through bounded HTTP requests with stalled upload bounds. Repair runs resolve draft releases with pagination, compare SHA-256 digests instead of trusting equal file sizes, and finalize the existing release by numeric id, preventing mixed-build updater manifests, duplicate releases, and tags on the wrong commit (`release.yml`).

## [1.0.2] - 2026-09-17

Docker server deployment, connected-server identity, and Termux guidance since 1.0.1.

- **Supported Docker server deployment (#145).** The published image `ghcr.io/ryderasking/pichamber` runs the web server only with `PICHAMBER_UI_PASSWORD` required, `PICHAMBER_HOST=0.0.0.0` in-container, and host loopback publish on `32145` by default (`PICHAMBER_HOST_PORT`, `PICHAMBER_BIND_ADDRESS`, `PICHAMBER_DATA_DIR`, `PICHAMBER_VERSION` overrides, per-project `-p`/`DATA_DIR` isolation). The entrypoint pre-creates mount roots as root then permanently drops to UID `1000:1000` via `setpriv` with no capabilities, keeps the server as PID 1 in foreground `serve`, and tolerates read-only/unwritable SSH mounts with warnings instead of failing. Images ship `init: true`, `no-new-privileges`, `/health` healthchecks, OCI labels, and pinned cloudflared `2026.3.0` multi-arch digest, with `docker.mdx`, install/quickstart/security/environment/cli docs, `CONTRIBUTING.md`, and web README coverage for projects, Pi config copy/bind, symlinked dotfiles, backups, upgrades, network access, and ownership (`Dockerfile`, `docker-compose.yml`, `docker-compose.build.yml`, `docker-entrypoint.sh`, `.env.example`, `docker.mdx`, `install.mdx`, `quickstart.mdx`, `security.mdx`, `environment.mdx`, `cli.mdx`, `connect-devices.mdx`).
- **Container server defaults and origin metadata (#145).** Docker images set `PICHAMBER_DEPLOYMENT_KIND=docker` and seed a fresh-store-only `Workspaces` project at `/home/pichamber/workspaces` via `createDockerInitialLocalSettings`; removing it is respected and never re-seeded. `/health`, `/api/version`, and server status report `deploymentKind`, `serverPlatform`, and `serverDistribution` verbatim so clients adapt without probing, backed by `detectLinuxDistribution` (`ID` plus `ID_LIKE` aliases for Arch/Ubuntu/Fedora/CentOS derivatives, null off-Linux or unknown) with a documented contract (`index.js`, `ui-settings-store.js`, `core-routes.js`, `linux-distribution.js`).
- **Connected server identity in the header (#145).** Remote runtimes show a `This server` menu with the deployment/distro icon, platform label, version, and copyable address, replacing the desktop services menu when connected. Copy uses the shared `copyTextToClipboard` fallback, open state is shared with the header shortcut, and Docker/Windows/macOS/Linux-distro icons are added to the sprite (`ConnectedServerMenu`, `serverPlatformIcon`, `serverPlatformLabel`, `Header`, `DesktopServicesMenu`, `clipboard`, `sprite`, `generate-icon-sprite`).
- **Container updates direct to Compose with release publishing (#145).** In-container `pichamber update` stays disabled; `DOCKER_DEPLOYMENT` capability now returns copyable `docker compose pull` / `docker compose up -d` commands with persisted-volume guidance. The Release workflow publishes `linux/amd64`+`linux/arm64` images on stable and RC tags (dry-run aware) and gates release finalization on its success; the manual Docker image smoke workflow stays parked (`package-manager`, `release.yml`, `docker-image.yml`).
- **Fresh-install draft starters preserved (#145).** The desktop settings migration preserves an absent starter list as the fresh-install sentinel for built-in starters instead of persisting an empty list, while still sanitizing legacy skill/command starters idempotently via `buildDraftStarterMigrationPatch` (`persistence`).
- **Tested Termux server setup (#147).** Install docs cover Android Termux with `pkg install nodejs clang make python` plus `npm install -g @pi-chamber/web --nodedir="$PREFIX"` for the node-gyp Android-headers workaround (`nodejs/node-gyp#3355`), normal `serve`/`status`/`stop`/`restart` use, no `nohup` foreground wrapping, and no systemd boot startup (`install.mdx`).

## [1.0.1] - 2026-09-16

Pi completion alerts, supported-runtime gates, and turn-status fixes since 1.0.0.

- **Pi completion and error alerts (#144).** A server-owned Pi daemon watcher delivers completion and terminal-error notifications across web/PWA, Electron, hosted mobile, and Capacitor mobile via Web Push, APNs/FCM relay, and native callbacks. Notifications fire only for completed work or terminal errors with stable deduplication tags, settle affected messages and tools, ignore bootstrap snapshots and interruptions, and suppress background push while an interactive client is visible unless always-notify is set. Bodies exclude prompt text, model output, tool output, and error details, and push registrations live in a private bounded store (`pi-notification-watcher`, `delivery-runtime`, `routes`, `notification-store`, `pi-session-store`, `useNativePushRegistration`, `push`, `notifications`).
- **Terminal errors show once per turn (#144).** Tool-heavy failed turns no longer render the same terminal error on every streaming assistant message; the final assistant message owns the terminal chat error while earlier continuing segments settle without error duplication (`streamReducers`, `event-reducer`).
- **Retired notification preferences removed (#144).** Subtask/question notification toggles and notification templates are removed from UI state, desktop/server persistence, and settings sync with a v20 UI-store migration, leaving Work completed and Errors event rows (`useUIStore`, `settingsSanitizers`, `settingsStoreSync`, `ui-settings-store`, `NotificationSettings`, `settings/search`).
- **Supported runtimes pinned to Node.js >=22.19.0 and Bun >=1.4.0 (#143).** Unsupported Node/Bun versions now fail fast before server startup or startup-service installation with clear upgrade guidance, while help/status/stop remain available. CI pins Bun 1.4.2 and Node 24, Docker uses Bun 1.4.2, `.nvmrc` tracks Node 24, and Electron keeps its bundled Node in-process. Linux x64 is supported on Node 24 and Bun 1.4.0/1.4.2 with Pi 0.85.1, gated by runtime smoke across Node 22.19/24 and Bun 1.4.0/1.4.2 (`runtime-requirements`, `server-runtime`, `cli-startup`, `pi-runtime-smoke`, `runtime-smoke`).
- **Background and dev servers prefer Node with Bun fallback (#142).** Background `serve` reuses the current supported Node executable, then probes PATH `node`, then falls back to the configured Bun binary instead of starting a half-working server; dev servers share the same helper with single-child lifecycle, and foreground serve stays inline with no spawned runtime (`server-runtime`, `dev-server`, `commands-serve`, `cli`).
- **Continuing assistant turns stay live across tool execution (#141).** `assistant.message.end` with `continuing: true` now keeps `streaming: true` and live `streamingMessages` ownership across the text-segment boundary, so the working footer no longer flashes settled mid-turn or freezes on later `tool.start` mutations; terminal and error ownership semantics are unchanged (`streamReducers`, `continuingMessageLiveStatus`).
- **Updater release notes render as markdown.** Desktop update checks consume the full changelog range and render GitHub release bodies with markdown instead of raw text, with fallback parsing that accepts numbered RC versions (`updater-check`, `main.mjs`).
- **Settings navigation icons refreshed.** Settings nav swaps to clearer icons (equalizer, server, brush, chat, voiceprint, puzzle, terminal-box, history, git-repository, global, PiChamber mark) and prunes unused sprite entries (`metadata`, `sprite`, `generate-icon-sprite`).

## [1.0.0] - 2026-09-14

Desktop menu repairs, separate client and server update status, and clearer npm guidance since 0.9.9.

- **Electron application menu actions work again (#140).** Renderer-owned menu commands now reach the full desktop UI through the preload event bridge, restoring About, Settings, update checks, the command palette, session and project navigation, theme controls, sidebars, terminal actions, help, diagnostics, and mini-chat. Native Electron roles remain in the main process, invalid payloads are ignored, and listener cleanup covers partial setup and unmounts (`useDesktopMenuActions`, `desktopMenuEvents`, `AppEffects`, `folderCycle`).
- **Remote desktop shows client and server updates separately.** About now reports both versions, checks each update feed, marks the outdated target, and opens the matching updater instead of combining desktop-client and connected-server state. Update channel rows use the saved server label when available and keep local desktop installs as one update target (`AboutSettings`, `DesktopUpdateChannelSettings`, `SettingsSection`, `useUpdateStore`).
- **The npm package README is easier to use.** `@pi-chamber/web` now leads with runtime requirements, package-manager install and one-shot commands, guided and non-interactive serve examples, a concise command table, automation guarantees, and security guidance (`packages/web/README.md`).

## [0.9.9] - 2026-09-14

Predictable server updates with transient workers and pollable jobs since 0.9.8.

- **RC updates select the highest available release.** Desktop and server RC subscriptions now compare the stable and numbered RC channel heads and offer the higher semantic version instead of requiring an intermediate stable update first. Stable subscriptions remain stable-only, and final releases continue to outrank prereleases of the same version (`updater-check`, `package-manager`, `DesktopUpdateChannelSettings`).
- **Server update channels with RC subscriptions (#139).** The server now supports `stable` versus `rc` update channels alongside the desktop app channel. RC subscribers compare `latest` and `rc` heads and are offered the newest eligible version; stable subscribers stay stable-only (`package-manager`, `routes`, `ui-settings-store`).
- **Desktop app and server channels are configurable.** Settings → About configures the desktop app channel over local Electron IPC and the server channel against the active runtime while the Local instance is active. Both persist host-local in `runtime-state.json` (`desktopUpdateChannel`, `serverUpdateChannel`, default `stable`), reject unknown values, and are searchable in Settings (`DesktopUpdateChannelSettings`, `Header`, `SettingsView`, `desktopSystemActions`, `persistence`, `settings/search`).
- **Managed systemd updates run in a transient worker.** Startup-enabled servers no longer refuse updates from inside `pichamber.service` on generic `INVOCATION_ID`: detection uses the generated unit marker plus cgroup leaf, and installs launch via `systemd-run` outside the service so the updater survives restarts. Non-secret job state persists under the PiChamber run dir with cross-process locking, worker liveness, and stale-job replacement, with deployment capability reporting for Docker, source checkouts, custom units, and ownership mismatches (`update-job-store`, `package-manager`, `cli-startup`).
- **CLI updates coordinate through jobs and systemd delegation.** `pichamber update` runs shared deployment-capability preflight with stable reason codes, delegates browser-terminal and in-service runs to the transient systemd worker, claims jobs for direct runs to prevent concurrent installs, records `installing`/`verifying`/`restarting` progress, and verifies the newly installed global package path. Generated systemd units are marked and systemd markers are stripped from persisted startup env (`commands-update`, `cli-args`, `package-manager`, `DOCUMENTATION.md`, `cli.mdx`).
- **Update installs return pollable jobs.** `POST /api/pi/update-install` returns 202 with a persisted job id and `GET /api/pi/update-install/:jobId` supports reconnect-safe polling across restarts. Capability is checked server-side before claiming jobs, version context flows into the launcher, and PTY shells carry `PICHAMBER_SERVER_TERMINAL` so custom-unit guidance only applies to server-descended terminals (`routes`, `update-job-store`, `terminal/runtime`).
- **Update dialog follows jobs and shows deployment commands.** Web update networking lives in `web-update.ts` with job-state polling across restarts, immediate worker-failure reporting, and lost-job handling. `UpdateDialog` follows `queued`/`installing`/`verifying`/`restarting`, preserves server-provided manual commands, and renders per-command copy actions with errors before commands (`web-update`, `UpdateDialog`, `server-update-events`, `useUpdateStore`, `Header`).
- **Job lifecycle and desktop checks hardened.** Runtime-scoped job observation, serialized newest-eligible desktop checks, and hardened RC feed handling keep one failed entity from blocking unrelated updates (`update-job-store`, `updater-check`, `main.mjs`).
- **Docs explain app/server channels and systemd flow.** App versus server channel ownership, transient-unit updates for startup-enabled servers, persisted job polling, and required manual actions for containers, source checkouts, custom units, and ownership mismatches (`cli.mdx`, `install.mdx`, `packages/web/README.md`, `packages/electron/README.md`, `terminal/DOCUMENTATION.md`).
- **Update channel settings show full channel names.** The Desktop app and Server update channel dropdowns now display `Stable` / `Release candidate` in the closed trigger instead of the raw `stable` / `rc` values. The server row keeps a single-line label with the connected host shown underneath, so both Updates rows share the same shape (`DesktopUpdateChannelSettings`).
- **Update dialogs show release notes for desktop and server releases.** Desktop updates now consume electron-updater's full-changelog arrays and limit them to the selected version range. When updater or hosted notes are absent, desktop and server checks read the exact GitHub release body before falling back to the selected tag's `CHANGELOG.md`; the fallback parser accepts numbered RC versions instead of silently dropping them (`updater-check`, `main.mjs`, `package-manager`).

## [0.9.8] - 2026-09-12

Desktop update channels, stream-epoch-bound sends, and startup-recovery hardening since 0.9.7.

- **Desktop update channels with RC subscriptions (#137).** Settings → About now offers Stable versus Release candidate while the Local instance is active. Stable reads only the `latest` updater manifests; Release candidate checks `latest` first, then `rc`, so it receives numbered RC builds and then the final stable. The subscription is host-local in `runtime-state.json` (`desktopUpdateChannel: stable | rc`, default `stable`), rejects unknown values, and is searchable in Settings. The release workflow publishes separate `latest*` and `rc*` manifests (`rc-mac.yml`, `rc.yml`, `rc-linux.yml`, `rc-linux-arm64.yml`), marks RC GitHub releases as prereleases, and publishes opt-in npm RCs under the `rc` dist-tag (`npm install -g @pi-chamber/web@rc`); the Electron setting does not affect npm installs (`updater-channel`, `updater-check`, `finalize-latest-yml`, `release.yml`, `ui-settings-store`, `DesktopUpdateChannelSettings`, `AboutSettings`, `install.mdx`).
- **Stable launches wire to the website; RCs stay quiet.** Stable releases require `PICHAMBER_WEBSITE_REPO_TOKEN` and send `site_refresh_requested` to `RyderAsKing/PiChamber-web`; prereleases skip the dispatch and docs sync. The docs-source workflow now only validates and archives `packages/docs` without auto-syncing a website (`release.yml`, `docs-source.yml`, `DEPLOYMENT.md`).
- **Sends bind to the stream epoch (#138).** Prompt, steer, and follow-up intents now carry the health-verified `streamEpoch`, and send identity is `kind + session + operationId + streamEpoch`. A missing, changed, or retired epoch becomes `STALE_STREAM_EPOCH` (HTTP 409) / `PiSendUnconfirmedError` instead of executing under the wrong daemon lifetime. Receipt lookups include the epoch and never invoke Pi; queued and composer sends hold for explicit Check-status review instead of cross-epoch replay (`send-operation-registry`, `session-daemon`, `routes`, `client`, `transport`, `messageQueueStore`, `useQueuedMessageAutoSend`, `ChatInput`).
- **Startup replay starts from a snapshot baseline.** Pre-bootstrap recovery streams omit `fromSequence`/`streamEpoch` until an epoch is established, and health preserves the restart-safe epoch so cursors stay scoped to the current daemon lifetime (`transport`, `client`).
- **Persisted session directories are revalidated.** Startup no longer trusts a stale persisted directory hint: web/desktop rediscover the session by id against the connected runtime, native mobile confirms against its authoritative catalog restore, and a failed lookup falls back to a current project without carrying the unverified session id (`pi-session-store`, `pi-session-context`, `last-session-cache`, `sync/DOCUMENTATION.md`).
- **Desktop credentials restore before URL-token minting.** Web bootstrap waits for `restoreDesktopRelayRuntime` before minting runtime URL auth tokens, so startup uses the active endpoint and credential instead of producing a startup 401 from a stale injected token (`runtimeConfig`).
- **Shell settings stay visible on remote runtimes.** Launch at login, tray, keep-awake, and performance-recording desktop settings remain available when the local Electron window uses a remote PiChamber runtime; only network-access controls stay local-only (`DesktopNetworkSettings`, `PiChamberPage`, `main.mjs`, `README.md`).
- **Release-branch workflow documented.** `CONTRIBUTING.md` now describes `release/X.Y.Z` stabilization branches, numbered `-rc.N` candidates, and cherry-pick forward-ports instead of merging the release branch back to `main`.

## [0.9.7] - 2026-09-12

A stability release for live connections, reconnects, and session recovery.

- **Device revocation now ends live access (#9).** Revoking a paired device immediately closes its authenticated event stream, terminal, and dictation connections, whether they are direct or relayed. Sign-out closes every tracked live connection while rotating the JWT secret. New SSE and WebSocket connections re-check the verified credential at establishment, so a revoked credential cannot win an in-flight token race. Revocations made by another process reach the running server within the bounded 15-second credential poll (`client-auth`, `ui-auth`, `terminal`, `stt`, `server`).
- **Event streams recover safely across server restarts.** Each daemon start has an opaque stream epoch. Clients reject stale-epoch events and cursors, then establish an authoritative baseline instead of replaying the wrong process's history. SSE setup and URL-token minting have deadlines; known authentication failures stop retrying and return to the existing authentication flow, while temporary failures keep local work and retry with bounded backoff (`session-daemon`, `transport`, `bootstrap`, `reconnect`, `runtime-auth`).
- **SSE connections have bounded cleanup and backpressure.** Server event streams install cleanup before subscription completes, stop subscriptions on disconnect or shutdown, and close slow readers once their buffered output reaches the 8 MiB limit or their drain deadline expires. Shutdown now has a finite termination deadline, so a stalled client cannot hold the server open (`event-stream`, `routes`, `server`).
- **Reconnect recovery preserves complete state.** Same-epoch replay no longer reloads resident sessions unnecessarily. A verified resync or epoch change queues bounded recovery for selected sessions and known directory catalogs; failed scopes retain retry obligations until they complete, and successful scopes remain usable. Epoch resets preserve drafts, attachments, optimistic prompts, navigation, and catalog metadata while replacing stale transcript cursors (`pi-session-store`, `sync`, `reconnect`).
- **Session deletion stays authoritative across runtimes.** Runtime-scoped deletion tombstones prevent a deleted session from returning from stale cache, replay, or reconnect data. The current-session deletion path opens the correct fresh draft without erasing unrelated session state (`pi-session-store`, `session catalog`).
- **Terminal and mobile connections tolerate temporary transport loss.** Terminal streams reattach after a runtime transport switch. Native mobile clients retain their saved endpoint, cached sessions, and drafts during an outage, pause sends until recovery, and use bounded foreground retries that do not overwrite an explicit disconnect or host switch (`terminal`, `MobileApp`, `mobile connection recovery`).
- **Desktop tray behavior is configurable.** General settings now let desktop users choose separate minimize and close behavior for the system tray. New installs minimize to the taskbar and hide on close; existing installations retain their previous tray preference until changed (`Electron`, `DesktopNetworkSettings`).

## [0.9.6] - 2026-09-10

Send reliability, revision-safe file saves, and file-search correctness release.

- **Deleting the current session opens a fresh draft (#123).** `deleteSession`/`deleteSessions` now route through `session-ui-store` so deleting the visible session clears the selection and opens a new-session draft instead of leaving a deleted transcript on screen. Deleting another session keeps the current selection, failed deletes stay put, and a session selected mid-delete wins without being stolen (`session-ui-store`, `SessionDialogs`, `session-ui-delete-navigation`).
- **`/api/fs/find` resolves workspaces and filters ignored files safely (#124).** Find uses shared workspace resolution with realpath boundary checks, directory stat, and 1–500 limit clamping, keeps result paths in the requested symlink space, and emits directory candidates for `type=directory`. Git-ignore filtering uses bounded concurrency with a shared in-flight cache and a configurable timeout (`PICHAMBER_GIT_CHECK_IGNORE_TIMEOUT_MS`, 2500 ms default), failing closed on error/timeout instead of returning possibly-ignored files, with regression coverage and contract docs (`fs/routes`, `fs/search`, `fs/DOCUMENTATION.md`).
- **Editor saves are revision-guarded with explicit conflict recovery (#125).** Reads expose opaque `v1:<size>:<mtimeMs>[:<sha256>]` revisions (`x-pichamber-file-revision`, `Cache-Control: no-store`), `GET /api/fs/stat` supports `?knownRevision=` fast-path checks, and `POST /api/fs/write` accepts `{ expectedRevision, overwrite }` with create-only `null`, explicit force, idempotent noop on identical content, per-file serialization, atomic temp+rename, and HTTP 409 `{ reason: 'file-revision-conflict' }` on stale writes. The UI keeps a revision cache, drops stale completions across file/runtime switches, reconciles stat updates, and offers reload/overwrite/compare via `FileSaveConflictDialog`; standalone `DiagramView` recovers without losing edits. CORS exposes revision headers for HMR/desktop/Capacitor, and the exact `~` sentinel resolves to the server home before workspace validation (`fileRevisionCache`, `useFileEditorSave`, `useFileViewerModes`, `useFileStatReconciliation`, `FilesView`, `DiagramView`, `files-errors`, `files`, `fs/routes`, `cors`, `workspace/host`).
- **Send operations deduplicate by stable identity with exact receipts (#126).** Clients label prompt/steer/follow-up sends with a stable `operationId`; the daemon claims `kind+session+id` before Pi activation, deduplicates identical retries to the original receipt (`deduplicated: true`), shares pending outcomes, rejects payload mismatches with 409 and expired retention with 410, and serves exact read-only `POST /api/pi/sessions/:sessionId/send-receipt` lookups (`accepted`/`pending`/`expired`/`unknown`) without invoking Pi (`send-operation-registry`, `session-daemon`, `routes`, `protocol`, `client`).
- **Receipts wait for Pi acceptance and survive preparation races (#126).** The daemon confirms SDK preflight before recording send receipts instead of acknowledging rejected prompts, preserves delivery intent across preparation races, separates pending attachment metadata for steering and follow-ups, and documents bounded dedup retention with acceptance/rejection/pending-duplicate/ordering coverage (`session-daemon`, `prompt-operations`, `prompt-preflight`).
- **Uncertain sends recover without replay (#126).** The UI forwards stable operation/message IDs with captured runtime and directory scope, disables automatic retries after uncertain responses, recovers only from exact accepted receipts, and preserves uploads when acceptance is unknown (`pi-session-store`, `pi/client`, `protocol`, `session-ui-message-routing`, `pi-session-connection`).
- **Follow-up and steering delivery is predictable (#126).** Follow-ups stay independent with atomic send claims, drafts and captured config survive dispatch, uncertain delivery pauses for read-only status checks, and capacity overflow rejects without deleting pending messages. `Queue` is renamed to `Follow-up` with saved behavior/defaults preserved, SDK pending counts surface in the composer, and follow-ups remain device-local (`ChatInput`, `QueuedMessageChips`, `messageQueueStore`, `queuedSendReceipt`, `useQueuedMessageAutoSend`, `composer/DOCUMENTATION.md`).
- **Steered turns keep honest timing (#126).** Working status requires ownership of the authoritative stream, steered turns show `Steering agent` live and `Worked for <duration> · Steered` when settled, and settled turns no longer invent a duration before completion (`TurnBlock`, `TurnItem`, `TurnWorkingHeader`, `assistantWorkingState`, `projectTurnRecords`).
- **Workspace edge cases hardened.** Branch-only history requests use the resolvable-base gate so a missing conventional `main` fallback never reaches the Git log API, and Git history scope follows `branchScopeAvailable` (`GitView`, `apps/DOCUMENTATION.md`).

## [0.9.5] - 2026-09-09

Pi-native cleanup, bounded performance, LAN reliability, and refreshed model catalog release.

- **Pi SDK 0.85.1 refreshes the OpenCode model catalog (#122).** Bundled `opencode.json` drops `deepseek-v4-flash-free` and picks up the upstream catalog fixes. Existing Pi sessions, credentials, settings, and custom models stay in place with no manual migration or cache deletion; custom additions and overrides still apply to the updated catalog. Adds disposable-directory catalog/session regression coverage (`sdk-upgrade.test.js`) and upgrade notes (`session-daemon/DOCUMENTATION.md`, `packages/web/README.md`, `@earendil-works/pi-coding-agent`). If a saved default points at a removed model, pick an available replacement.
- **File tree and daemon work stay bounded (#117).** The file tree builds one per-snapshot `fileTreeStatus` index (`openPaths` set, git status map, folder-badge ancestor counts) so rows answer with O(1) lookups instead of scanning changed files per directory, with gating that skips tree work when the Files surface is not visible (`fileTreeStatus`, `useFilesTree`, `FilesView`). The daemon keeps only a contiguous byte- and count-bounded replay suffix (1024 events / 8 MiB wire bytes, whole-event eviction, oversized events broadcast live but not retained with snapshot fallback) plus bounded idle runtime residency and replay (`session-replay`, `session-daemon`, `prompt-operations`). STT no longer queues work after shutdown (`worker-client`).
- **Session catalog is single-owner with concurrent-mutation reconciliation (#118).** The duplicate `useGlobalSessionsStore`/`globalSessions` list is retired; `pi-session-catalog` is the owner with `session-catalog-access` reads and `pi-session-catalog-feeder` wiring, reconciling catalog lists against concurrent create/archive/remove mutations instead of dropping live entries. Mobile last-session restore and widget snapshots move to focused owners (`mobileLastSessionRestore`, `mobileWidgetSnapshot`, `sessionDirectory`), session auto-cleanup threads the owning directory through archive/remove, and per-session selection preferences consolidate into `selection-store` (retiring `contextStore`, `contextUtils`, `permissionUtils`). (`pi-session-catalog`, `session-catalog-access`, `pi-session-store`, `session-ui-store`, `selection-store`, `useSessionAutoCleanup`, `MobileApp`, `AppEffects`).
- **Chat keeps one activity path with safe send gates (#118).** Assistant turns render through a single `TurnActivityRail`/`AssistantMessageBody` path; the duplicate tool-state owner (`useChatMessageToolsState`) is replaced by `useChatMessagePopupState`, unreachable response-lifecycle branches and `assistantMessageTypes` variants are removed, and render comparison covers the retained path (`renderCompare`, `StaticToolRow`, `chatDefaults.regression`). Queued auto-sends gate on live Pi session state instead of persisted history, response-style instructions inject only on the first user prompt (`responseStyle`), and unused session/viewport fields, retired streaming/directory state (`streaming`, `viewport-store`, `global-session-status`, `session-ordering`, `useSessionPrefetch`, bootstrap demands), and dynamic imports for already-bundled stores are removed. (`ChatMessage`, `AssistantMessageBody`, `TurnActivityRail`, `useAssistantMessageLifecycle`, `useQueuedMessageAutoSend`, `ChatInput`, `composer/DOCUMENTATION.md`, `sync/DOCUMENTATION.md`).
- **Retired Pi-duplicated and dead UI state removed (#118).** The Pi-native generic-agent registry/loading/selection layer (agents, `currentAgentName`, agent model selections, agent-mention parsing) and obsolete sync/bootstrap/permission plumbing (`child-store`, `global-sync-store`, bootstrap demands, directory shims, permission/question hooks) are deleted with consumer updates and owning-docs coverage. Chat/file/window defaults are fixed: obsolete presentation preferences (reasoning traces, collapsible thinking, draft persistence, spellcheck, wide layout, line wrap, file icons, changed-files pills, expanded tools, mermaid/user rendering modes, collapsible/sticky user, prompt navigator, split actions, `directoryShowHidden`, `fileViewerPreview`) and `userModelChoice`/`executionMeta` helpers are retired with `MANUAL-ONLY COLLAPSED` reasoning, always-markdown user text, always-wrap code, SVG mermaid, and edit-default file viewers plus regression coverage; server `ui-settings-store` allowlists drop the same retired keys so saved values cannot restore retired behavior. Gitmoji picker/matcher/preferences and `useGitmojiList` are removed. Window chrome is right-side classic minimize/maximize/close on frameless Windows/Linux (native traffic lights on macOS, none on web/mobile) with the persist v19 migration. (`config`, `session-ui-store`, `session-ui-types`, `persistence`, `appearancePersistence`, `ui-settings-store`, `ModelControls`, `useConfigStore`, `WindowsWindowControls`, `Header`, `TitlebarLeftControls`, `PiChamberVisualSettings`).
- **LAN HTTP works without `crypto.randomUUID` (#121).** New shared `createBrowserUuid` uses `crypto.randomUUID` when available and formats `crypto.getRandomValues` bytes as UUID v4 otherwise (no `Math.random` fallback; missing sources throw), so prompt IDs and mobile connections work on insecure LAN HTTP contexts across web, desktop, hosted-mobile, and Capacitor. (`uuid`, `mobileConnections`, `mobileConnectionStorage`, `pi-session-store`, `pi-session-connection`).

## [0.9.4] - 2026-09-07

Settings-safe idle activation, stable run timers across reload, and responsive Linux updates release.

- **Pi settings apply when sessions go idle (#115).** Provider catalog, project trust, resource, behavior, and prompt-template writes now persist immediately without interrupting active turns. Resident-runtime recreation queues behind a revision counter and flushes at the next safe lifecycle edge, staying pending across transient rebuild failures so a later edge retries; new sessions read the committed file at once. Responses carry a `deferred` flag through the public `/api/pi/*` projections so browsers distinguish saved-but-pending activation from immediate effect. Behavior, provider catalog, project trust, and prompt-template surfaces show saved-when-idle info instead of success or `SESSION_BUSY` errors via shared `isDeferredPiMutation` / `isSessionBusyError` helpers, and prompt-template mutations return deferred/busy distinctly instead of reporting a committed write as failed after a runtime switch (`session-daemon`, `prompt-operations`, `routes`, `protocol`, `client`, `mutation-status`, `usePromptTemplatesStore`, `BehaviorPage`, `useProvidersPageState`, `ProjectTrustDialog`, `PromptTemplatesPage`).
- **Agent and tool timers survive reload (#116).** The session daemon keeps a bounded per-session timing cache (2048 entries, cleared on delete and shutdown), projects `startedAt`/`endedAt` through `getSession` hydration, and samples `serverNow` on tool start/update/end (whitelisted on the public route projection) so a second client or browser reload keeps tool origins. The UI normalizes server-epoch stamps to the client clock via a shared `server-clock` helper (older runtimes without `serverNow` pass through), adopts `runStartedAt`/`serverNow` on bootstrap, reconnect, background refresh, and snapshot (busy or retry with a finite start, with repeated busy events no longer beating the first snapshot), hides the thinking-loader elapsed readout while `startedAt` is null, and prefers the server start over the local pending fallback once present so reload resumes the same count instead of flashing a fresh one (`session-daemon`, `routes`, `protocol`, `types`, `server-clock`, `sessionProjection`, `streamReducers`, `bootstrap`, `reconnect`, `session-activity-timing`, `pi-session-store`, `pi-session-connection`, `AgentThinkingLoader`, `ToolPart`, `WorkingPlaceholder`).
- **Hidden history pages keep loading.** `loadOlderMessages` now returns whether another page remains, and the new `useOlderHistoryDemand` hook keeps demand active across cursors: when a loaded page adds no scrollable height (records hidden inside an existing turn gate), it advances to the next server cursor without requiring a scroll event the browser cannot emit at `scrollTop 0`. `MessageList` uses the hook with viewport-anchored prepends, keeping underfill and near-top behavior unchanged (`pi-session-store`, `useOlderHistoryDemand`, `MessageList`, `sync-context`, `sync/DOCUMENTATION.md`).
- **Linux updates stay responsive (#113).** AppImage validation extracts asynchronously (`spawn` with timeout instead of blocking `spawnSync`), so a slow extraction no longer freezes the Electron window, with a heartbeat regression test. New `linux-package-update` support installs downloaded `.deb`/`.rpm`/`pacman` packages through the resolved native manager (`dpkg`/`apt`, `zypper`/`dnf`/`yum`/`rpm`, `pacman`) via an async elevated runner that unescapes electron-updater installer paths; polkit/sudo authentication no longer blocks the window, `desktop_restart` guards against re-entry, and `window-all-closed`/`before-quit` defer while the Linux installer owns shutdown (`linux-appimage-update`, `linux-package-update`, `main.mjs`, `README.md`).
- **Extension mode status stays live.** Stale hydration no longer erases a newer live `mode` extension status when a fetch lands behind an accepted live event, local live extension fields (`notices`, `errors`, catalog/session-tree revisions, editor) survive hydration regardless of sequence, and changing models always reapplies the selected thinking level since Pi resets thinking to the model default during `setModel` (`pi-session-store-helpers`, `session-ui-message-routing`).

## [0.9.3] - 2026-09-07

Large-session reliability, portable settings, and terminal/desktop polish release.

- **Large sessions open via bounded transcript pages (#112).** Opening a session whose projected transcript exceeds the 16 MiB daemon IPC frame no longer fails with a misleading `MALFORMED_DAEMON_RESPONSE`. `sessions.open`, `navigate`, `fork`, `clone`, and `create` now return metadata plus a byte- and count-bounded tail page; older history loads on demand through a new `sessions.messages` daemon command and `GET /api/pi/sessions/:sessionId/messages` (`before`/`limit` validated). The shared 16 MiB frame limit lives in `ipc-protocol.js` so client and daemon cannot drift, complete newline-delimited frames parse before the incomplete remainder is bounded, and oversized versus malformed frames map to distinct `DAEMON_RESPONSE_TOO_LARGE` / `MALFORMED_DAEMON_RESPONSE` 502 codes. Pages that start inside a tool loop anchor to the owning user message, a single unpageable message fails explicitly, and snapshots read the latest assistant directly instead of projecting everything. The UI carries `hasMoreBefore` / `beforeCursor` through `PiSessionDetailResponse` plus `piClient.getSessionMessages`, deduplicates older-page requests per cursor, merges pages with resident live records winning, preserves loaded history across reconnect tail refreshes, and loads older pages on underfill or near-top scroll with viewport anchoring; navigation replaces the branch and drops stale page state (`session-daemon`, `ipc-protocol`, `ipc-client`, `routes`, `protocol`, `client`, `sessionProjection`, `pi-session-store`, `pi-session-store-helpers`, `MessageList`, `sync-context`).
- **Portable preferences separate from machine state (#110).** `settings.json` now holds only allowlisted portable preferences (`__pichamberSettingsScope: portable-v1`) while host, device, and secret-bearing values live in `runtime-state.json`. `/api/pi/ui-settings` keeps its merged route contract, reading both files and splitting writes by scope; legacy flat files migrate automatically (local state written before the portable replacement, atomic writes, malformed files stay errors, unknown fields dropped by allowlist). Copying the portable file to another host no longer imports absolute project paths or that host's home directory. Electron persists install identity, host connections, local credentials, port, and window state in `runtime-state.json` with a pre-migration fallback to the legacy flat file, and the web CLI reads the desktop local port and client token from runtime state with the same fallback (`ui-settings-store`, `main.mjs`, `cli-paths`, `session-daemon/DOCUMENTATION.md`).
- **Terminal paste no longer duplicates input (#111).** Keyboard paste on Linux/Windows (`Ctrl+Shift+V`, `Shift+Insert`) now relies solely on the native xterm paste event, matching the existing macOS path, instead of firing both the native event and a manual clipboard read. One paste gesture produces one terminal input. Context-menu paste is unchanged (no browser paste event on click, so it keeps the manual clipboard read); copy shortcuts, `Ctrl+C` SIGINT behavior, and OSC 52 policy are unchanged (`TerminalViewport`, `terminalClipboard`).
- **Fresh installs keep reasoning expanded (#109).** The `collapseThinkingByDefault` install default flips from `true` to `false`, so new installs show a one-line reasoning trace unless the user opts into collapse. Existing persisted `true` values are preserved; only the missing-value default changes (`useUIStore`).
- **Linux desktop branding.** Linux packages ship the full hicolor icon set (16–1024px) generated from the PiChamber SVG mark via `bun run icons:brand`, `.deb`/`.rpm` gain a proper synopsis/description, and the desktop entry `Comment` is branded (`Run Pi Coding Agent sessions from the PiChamber desktop app.`). AppImage verification now checks the branded comment plus every hicolor icon path (`package.json`, `after-pack`, `verify-linux-appimage`, `generate-brand-icons`).

## [0.9.2] - 2026-09-06

Linux distribution and desktop update reliability release.

- **Native Linux packages.** Releases now include `.deb` and `.rpm` packages alongside portable AppImages for x64 and arm64. Package-manager installs retain Electron's normal Chromium sandbox and use the native package updater.
- **AppImage startup compatibility.** AppImages launch through a compatibility wrapper that passes `--no-sandbox` before Electron starts, avoiding the SUID sandbox failure on user-mounted filesystems. Installed `.deb` and `.rpm` packages keep the normal sandbox setup.
- **Safe AppImage updates.** Downloads are validated before replacement, the current image path is preserved for desktop shortcuts, and the previous image remains available until the restarted packaged UI confirms a successful launch. Failed restarts roll back on the next launch.
- **Startup diagnostics.** Missing packaged UI assets now show version, package, AppImage, and log diagnostics with recovery guidance instead of leaving a blank desktop window.

## [0.9.1] - 2026-09-06

Server-profile daemon isolation, first-run settings persistence, and public-launch cleanup release.

- **Pi daemon isolated by server profile (#103).** Dev/HMR and packaged servers (plus concurrent instances) no longer share or tear down each other's Pi daemon. Profile-scoped state covers sessions, folders, settings, snippets, model config, archive, client-auth pairing/remote-clients, git identity, STT config, and UI auth/passkeys, guarded by a cross-process lock with explicit `DAEMON_PROFILE_IN_USE` / `DAEMON_LOCK_UNAVAILABLE` / `DAEMON_OWNERSHIP_MISMATCH` errors and lease-aware supervisor restarts (`server-profile`, `cross-process-lock`, `supervisor`, `daemon-process`, `session-daemon`, `session-lease`).
- **Composer locks when a session is open elsewhere (#103).** A session leased by another instance now surfaces `SESSION_IN_USE`: send, voice, model, attach, and draft-target controls lock with a `Session is open elsewhere` placeholder instead of retrying into 409s. The transcript is preserved and the lock clears on the next successful hydrate (`ChatInput`, `protocol`, `pi-session-store-helpers`, `ChatContainer`).
- **Settings persist before the first folder (#106).** Appearance and model-preference autosave start right after desktop-settings sync, even with no folder selected. Local retention settings (`autoDeleteEnabled`, `autoDeleteAfterDays`, `sessionRetentionAction`) migrate from hydrated UI state when the server has no value, and providers/agents load in global scope on first run instead of skipping unknown/empty directories (`App`, `persistence`, `appearanceAutoSave`, `useConfigStore`).
- **Model favorites survive restarts (#104).** Model-preference autosave seeds from the current snapshot, flushes immediately on runtime switch and unmount, and only starts after settings sync; mini-chat and mobile init await settings before autosave so favorites are no longer lost across sessions (`modelPrefsAutoSave`, `persistence`, `App`, `renderElectronMiniChatApp`, `renderMobileApp`).
- **Git clone 404 fixed (#101).** Directory clone now posts to the registered `POST /api/fs/clone` route (was `/api/git/clone`), which supports stored Git identities and returns 409 for an existing destination, with server docs and regression coverage (`useDirectoryCloneAndAdd`, `fs/routes`, `fs/DOCUMENTATION.md`).
- **Mobile live feed tightened.** Phone-width chat uses a smaller semantic type scale, narrower message gutters, and compact activity-rail rows, tool indentation, expanded tool bodies, reasoning blocks, and task summaries. Desktop styling and larger controls are unchanged (`mobile.css`, `ChatMessage`, `TurnActivityRail`, `ReasoningPart`, `StaticToolRow`, `ToolPart`, `ToolExpandedContent`, `TaskToolSummary`, `AssistantTextPart`).
- **CLI machine modes are script-safe.** `--json`/`--quiet` seed before argument parsing so syntax errors still honor the strict JSON contract; `pichamber update` propagates warning/error exit codes in JSON and quiet output; `logs --lines` rejects non-positive-integer values instead of silently using the default; tunnel auto-start and `connect-url` auto-serve run quiet and non-interactive; QR art renders only on TTY so non-TTY `--qr` still emits a capturable pairing link; `--token-stdin` streams stdin with a 64KB cap (`bin/cli`, `cli-args`, `commands-update`, `commands-tunnel`, `commands-connect-url`, `cli-tunnel-profiles`, `package-manager`).
- **Documentation refreshed for public launch.** Reworked contributor setup, release guidance, security reporting, and reverse-proxy requirements; repositioned the README around the Pi-native product and added the Discord community link; updated install/quickstart/security/troubleshooting plus a new CLI reference (`cli.mdx`); refreshed mobile/runtime docs and project skills (`CONTRIBUTING.md`, `README.md`, `SECURITY.md`, `REVERSE_PROXY.md`, `packages/docs`, `packages/web/README.md`, `packages/mobile/README.md`, `packages/electron/README.md`, `.agents/skills`).
- **Maintenance:** removed stale OpenChamber-era planning, migration, research, and reference assets (`PROVIDERS_PLAN.md`, pi workstreams, `pichamber-pimigration`, per-message revert plan, research notes, badge/reference screenshots, mobile `HANDOFF.md`, `oc-dev.config` example), dropped the release-workflow Discord notification step, corrected desktop smoke defaults, and renamed the review workflow to `pr-checks` with a simplified release-build test script.

## [0.9.0] - 2026-09-05

Terminal renderer, guided CLI flows, Git header consolidation, and desktop performance recording release.

- **Terminal moves from ghostty-web to xterm.js.** Swaps the renderer to `@xterm/xterm` with the fit addon, keeps one mounted renderer per tab with directory-wide subscriptions so full-screen programs survive tab switches, adds a focused clipboard shortcut policy and xterm-aligned theme, and removes the `ghostty-web` dependency, type shim, patch, and legacy output helpers (`TerminalViewport`, `TerminalTabPane`, `useTerminalSessionStream`, `useTerminalTabsManager`, `terminalClipboard`, `terminalTheme`).
- **Terminal header collapses to a single row (#94).** Replaces the per-terminal tab strip plus new/restart buttons with a `TerminalTabDropdown` using shared dropdown-trigger chrome, portalled into the `ContextPanel` header left of maximize. Hosts without panel chrome keep a single local dropdown row (`TerminalView`, `TerminalTabDropdown`, `ContextPanel`).
- **Terminal viewport interaction fixes (#94).** xterm.js renders to canvas so the Electron native menu reports Copy/Paste as disabled: the shared context menu is now driven from the xterm selection (Copy/Paste/Select All) with the native menu suppressed on every runtime. The full-page terminal main view gains an opt-in close-view button back to chat, matching `DiagramView` (`terminalClipboard`, `TerminalViewport`, `TerminalView`, `MainLayout`).
- **WebSocket auth tokens bind to connections (#99).** `websocket()` accepts an explicit per-connection `oc_url_token` and `refreshRuntimeUrlAuthToken()` returns the token reserved for that dial, so terminal (`TerminalTransport`), Pi event streams (`transport`), and dictation (`DictationClient`) no longer race on the shared token. `clearRuntimeUrlAuthToken(expectedToken)` only clears when the expected token is still current, so a stale pre-open failure cannot invalidate a newer connection (`runtime-url`, `runtime-auth`, `terminalApi`, `transport`, `dictation-client`).
- **Guided serve and update flows (#98).** Explicit `pichamber serve` with no setup flags opens an interactive access, port, authentication, content, and process-mode wizard with a final review and confirmation; bare `pichamber`, flag-driven runs, non-TTY, `--quiet`, and `--json` stay non-interactive. `pichamber update` reviews old → target versions plus package manager and restart impact with `--yes`/`-y` to skip, verifies the installed version after upgrade, distinguishes previous/installed/latest in JSON and quiet output, and reports partial restart failures (foreground instances and stop failures) instead of silently skipping them. Tunnel `start` ends with a review and confirmation unless profile/mode are fully specified, broad `stop` confirms when more than one instance is affected unless `--force` or an explicit port is given, and `logs --quiet` emits raw lines (`commands-serve`, `commands-update`, `commands-tunnel`, `commands-lifecycle`, `commands-logs`, `cli-args`, `bin/cli`, `DOCUMENTATION.md`).
- **Git and diff headers consolidate into one row (#100).** Replaces `GitHeader` two-row layout plus the embedded `DiffView` toolbar with a single `GitUnifiedHeader` (branch, identity, change scope, sync, repository/diff overflow) and `IdentityDropdown`, portalled into new `ContextPanel` `gitHeaderSlot`/`diffHeaderSlot` following the terminal dropdown pattern. Upstream status folds into the sync tooltip, the dead PR chip wiring is removed, and mobile plus non-panel surfaces keep the inline toolbar with no action lost (`GitUnifiedHeader`, `IdentityDropdown`, `SyncActions`, `GitView`, `DiffView`, `ContextPanel`).
- **Git history and graph gain dedicated sidebar buttons (#97).** `History` and `Graph` move out of the Repository views overflow into their own ghost icon buttons (`h-8 w-8`) in the Git header.
- **Folder-cycle navigation follows the sidebar rail (#95).** `Ctrl+Shift+F` changed the active project and session but left the left folder rail highlighting the previous folder because selection was `SessionSidebar`-local. Selection is lifted into `useSidebarSpaceStore` so folder-cycle shortcuts move the rail exactly like a rail click; row-level session selection still never changes the view filter, with `folderCycleSelection.test.ts` regression coverage (`folderCycle`, `useSidebarSpaceStore`, `SessionSidebar`).
- **Electron process performance recording (#96).** Main process samples Electron CPU/memory metrics, Node heap, and web-contents count every 10 seconds and writes newline-delimited JSON under `<userData>/performance`, resuming after restart until disabled. Records carry aggregate process data only (no session IDs, paths, URLs, credentials, prompts, filenames, or message content). Renderer gets/sets enabled state through local-origin-gated desktop IPC, with a Settings → General → Diagnostics toggle plus search indexing (`process-performance-recorder.mjs`, `main.mjs`, `desktopSystemActions`, `DiagnosticsSection`, `PiChamberVisualSettings`, `README.md`).

## [0.8.2] - 2026-09-04

Prompt-template safety, shortcuts, background worktree tasks, and reliability fixes.

- **Prompt template edits no longer kill sessions.** Creating, updating, or deleting a prompt template no longer calls `runtimeRegistry.disposeAll()` and no longer fails with `SESSION_BUSY` while a runtime is streaming. Idle runtimes pick up the change through Pi `session.reload()` in place (session file, ID, and transcript untouched); busy runtimes defer until `agent_settled`/compaction completion. Global changes fan out to all runtimes, project changes stay scoped to that directory, and committed files return immediately while activation is deferred (`session-daemon`, `extension-bridge`, `prompt-operations`).
- **Terminal and dictation WebSockets survive restarts (#92).** `oc_url_token` minted at `/auth/url-token` is now an `EncryptJWT` (`dir`/`A256GCM`) sealed with a key derived from the persisted JWT secret instead of an in-memory map, so a server restart no longer invalidates a token the browser may still use for `/api/terminal/ws` or `/api/stt/ws`. Global sign-out still rotates the secret and invalidates outstanding tokens (`ui-auth`).
- **Shortcuts pruned, folder cycling added.** Removes dead bindings (`go-to-line`, `terminal-expanded`, `toggle-files`, prompt-navigator toggle, right-sidebar git/files tabs, services-tab cycle) and their Header/FilesView/keyboard/Electron-menu handlers, renames `toggle_right_sidebar` to `open_right_sidebar`, and adds `cycle_session_folder` / `cycle_draft_folder` backed by a new `folderCycle` module with unit tests. `HelpDialog` widens to Settings-window size with a two-column grid (`shortcuts`, `folderCycle`, `useKeyboardShortcuts`, `HelpDialog`, `KeyboardShortcutsSettings`, `main.mjs`).
- **Model picker ignores key repeat (#82).** Holding `mod+shift+m` no longer re-triggers the model selector on auto-repeat keydowns (`shouldHandleModelSelectorShortcut`).
- **Worktree creation moves to background tasks (#85).** New-session worktree sends are non-blocking: a `Worktree queued` toast fires and a fresh draft opens while the captured prompt materializes on `setup-ready`. Replaces the global banner with `BackgroundTasksMenu` (hidden when empty, no count badge, leftmost of the header right-side buttons) plus `WorktreeCreationToasts`; draft helpers and `useWorktreeCreationStore`/`session-ui-store` updated with regression tests.
- **Retention cleanup threads the owning directory (#84).** `PiSessionStore.archive/remove` accept an optional directory and resolve explicit arg → `catalog.byId` → focused sessions, `PiService.deleteSession` forwards `scope.directory` as `?directory=`, and `useSessionAutoCleanup` passes the resolved directory through. Fixes foreign-session `INVALID_SESSION` rejections when cleanup candidates live outside the focused folder, with client/store/candidate plus server owning/wrong-directory regression tests.
- **Activity and response reveal gates separated (#90).** `TurnAssistantBlock` now gates only final-response messages (filtering activity-rail `activityPartIds`, tool-only records, and progress text projected to the rail) instead of raw message count, and `TurnActivityRail` hides the `Load earlier activity` control while collapsed. Large settled turns still defer behind `Load earlier response` / `Load full response` at the 32-message boundary (`TurnAssistantBlock`, `TurnItem`, `TurnActivityRail`).
- **Tool and thinking presentation polish (#86).** Expandable tool rows hug context text instead of stretching `surface-subtle` across the row with duration pinned far-right like static read rows, static skill/read rows normalize to `items-center` rhythm, and thinking headers share a 20px line box (`items-center`, `h-5`, `leading-none`, preview at markdown size) so mono glyphs no longer drop (`ToolPart`, `StaticToolRow`, `ReasoningPart`).
- **Copy working directory in the header session menu (#87).** Adds a copy-CWD action to the header session menu (`Header`).
- **Dialog copy fixes (#88, #89).** Drops stray literal backslashes from quoted names in the Archive session, folder delete, desktop host-switcher toast, git-identity delete, and dev-server error copy (plain quotes matching `HeaderRetentionDialog`), and makes close-worktree warnings legible in dark and light themes (`ConfirmDialogs`, `SidebarSpacesBar`).
- **Relay test reliability (#83).** Scripted relay client test finishes async setup before dialing so the loopback socket cannot emit its one-shot `open` before the listener attaches (`host-client.test.js`).

## [0.8.1] - 2026-09-04

Turn activity timeline, authoritative live status, and attachment upload fix release.

- **Unified turn activity timeline.** Assistant turns now project reasoning, progress text, and tools through one chronological disclosure rail (`TurnActivityRail`, `TurnWorkingHeader`, `turnActivityModel`, `turnActivityDisclosure`, `useTurnToolsState`) with a one-line working header (live status while running, `Worked for <duration>` when settled) and batched tool reveal that preserves per-message expansion caches. Assistant message body, reasoning, and text parts align with the rail without rebuilding settled siblings during streams.
- **Live activity status is authoritative.** `useAssistantStatus` derives working/thinking/tool phrases from live channels (streaming assistant message, Pi snapshot, session activity timing) instead of persisted history, with normalized tool-name mapping (dotted/suffixed names plus expanded edit/search/fetch/task phrases) and authoritative start time. Temporary fallbacks clear when live state arrives; fetch failure never masquerades as idle.
- **Running-tool shimmer scoped to live verbs (#81).** Reintroduces `oc-shimmer-verb` with CSS-owned transparent fill reusing `AgentThinkingLoader` gradient stops/keyframes, a reduced-motion static dim fallback, and settled rows on static dim — without restarting sweeps on streaming remounts or touching footer gating (`MinDurationShineText`, `index.css`).
- **Refined tool presentation.** Compact static rows (`StaticToolRow`) for navigation tools plus refined expandable `ToolPart` headers, task summaries, and shared row typography; docs updated (`parts/DOCUMENTATION.md`).
- **macOS/Windows build fix.** Renames case-colliding `ChatSurfaceContext.tsx` to `chatSurfaceProvider.tsx` and updates imports so case-insensitive checkouts build.
- **Attachment uploads unblocked on desktop/mobile.** CORS preflight now allows `x-pichamber-mime` for `POST /api/pi/attachments`, fixing image uploads from `pichamber-ui://app`, `capacitor://localhost`, and loopback HMR (`cors.js`).

## [0.8.0] - 2026-09-03

Snippets, prompt templates, command catalog, streaming polish, and architecture consolidation release.

- **Snippets and prompt templates are now first-class.** Server adds a PiChamber snippets store backend with CRUD plus native commands catalog routes; Pi client and protocol are directory-scoped with snippets and commands. UI adds an ID-based snippets store with directory-scoped UI, a prompt-templates store/page with variable helpers, insert-only draft starters pinned to prompt templates (including one-time built-in text starters on the new-session welcome screen), and separate Snippets vs Prompt-templates settings surfaces with search. Skill mentions render as `/skill:name` links.
- **Composer slash and skills align with Pi resolution.** Adds a shared command catalog with executable invocation identity, clears runtime-scoped catalogs on endpoint reset, and integrates the catalog into the composer. Removes PiChamber-owned slash commands, refines command source filters, and keeps extension-command sessions on the composer-first empty surface. Session titles gain a shared helper with awaiting-first-prompt titles, and awaiting-first-prompt label plus extension toast delivery are fixed.
- **Chat streaming polish (#79, #80).** Fluid streaming arrivals with live tool/thinking shimmer and stable footers, stabilized streaming footers and tool states, pixel-grid Dots loader with shimmer status and footer arrival fade, and a copy button next to the composer branch name. Also removes the composer drag ring while keeping drop overlay edges distinct and widens chat columns (60rem base, 76rem wide).
- **Faster, more reliable new-session sends.** New-session sends show instant pending feedback, preserve feedback through dispatch, hide empty assistant echo until first renderable content, and speed up dispatch. Attachment drafts survive session switches with files kept consistent through send and render; relay connects fail fast with diagnostics instead of hanging on stall and handle already-connected host state.
- **Mobile and desktop UI polish.** Mobile new-session action moves to a floating button at the sidebar bottom, stale mobile header on session switch is fixed, composer changes trigger and header alignment are corrected, working loader type matches the stream with tool-sized timer, desktop header title/metadata collapse to a single line, performance overlay is draggable, model picker drops sorting/footer, and worktree close gains a safe confirmation flow.
- **Reduced surface.** Removes legacy desktop SSH instance manager, AI commit generation, deprecated context workflows, obsolete project notes surface, and dead presentation wrappers; docs align with the reduced feature surface. Attachment filename CORS header is allowed for browser uploads.
- **Architecture consolidation preserving behavior.** Stacked on `pichamber/reduce-size-p1`, this is a behavior-preserving consolidation that merges duplicated mobile/desktop Files and Git implementations, decomposes large config, UI, Git, session, persistence, chat, message, tool, and composer modules into focused owners (including shared Files/Git mobile chrome), cleans up the runtime Git contract, and removes shallow/dead wrappers; review fixes restore private relay client URL parameters (`v`, `role`, `serverId`, optional `grant`) and retryable handshake timeouts with regression tests.

## [0.7.2] - 2026-09-01

Attachments, worktree, extension, and startup reliability release.

- **Attachments upload before the prompt leaves.** Composer picker, drop, and paste now create card previews immediately and stream each file to `POST /api/pi/attachments` as `application/octet-stream` with `x-pichamber-filename`/`x-pichamber-mime` before prompt dispatch. The composer shows one strip inside the card that wraps on wide layouts and scrolls on narrow layouts; each card reads its own `preparing` / `uploading` (determinate progress when the runtime reports bytes) / `ready` / `failed` / `expired` state from `input-store.ts` with Retry and Remove actions. `Send` and `Queue` are gated until every draft attachment is `ready` (`Uploading attachments…` / `Retry or remove failed attachments` on the send/queue buttons and as toasts), keyboard submission repeats the gate, and queueing detaches cards without deleting server uploads. Prompt dispatch keeps cards visible until Pi accepts the prompt; payload-too-large, network, and runtime-changed failures leave attachments available for another attempt instead of clearing them. Server validates filenames, enforces expiry/TTL and per-file limits in `attachment-store.js`, supports `DELETE /api/pi/attachments/:id`, and the web client exposes `uploadAttachment`/`deleteAttachment` plus `runtime-upload.ts` progress reporting. Queued messages serialize ready attachments for persistence and restore (`#70`, `runtime-upload`, `attachment-store`, `ChatInput`, `FileAttachment`, `input-store`, `session-ui-store`).
- **Background worktree creation no longer steals focus.** The submit that starts a draft worktree captures its draft snapshot, prompt, and model config and keeps the returned receipt through completion. Selecting another session while the worktree builds no longer redirects the prompt or steals session focus; materialization creates the worktree session with `select: false` and prompts its new directory in the background, leaving the current session and active directory untouched. Failure preserves the draft and never falls back to the source checkout (`#71`, `useDraftWorktreeCreation`, `pi-session-store`, `session-ui-store`, `session-actions`).
- **Extension state hydrates on open and reconnect.** `sessions.open` and `session.snapshot` now include live extension state (`extensionStatuses`, `extensionWidgets`, `extensionDialogs`, `extensionPanels`, `extensionApps`, `extensionTitle`) built by `projectExtensionSnapshotState` and seeded from the daemon's per-session maps. First attach after a cold start no longer misses one-time startup statuses before the browser stream connects, and a second tab reopens with the same live panels (`#75`, `session-daemon`, `routes`, `event-reducer`, `bootstrap`, `reconnect`).
- **Large settled history no longer rebuilds on every token.** Settled assistant turns with long histories defer older blocks behind `Load older history` / `Load all history` (deterministic `TurnAssistantBlock` + `turnAssistantReveal`), so live replies avoid rebuilding the whole transcript and `MessageList` virtualization stays cheap (`#73`, `MessageList`, `TurnItem`, `TurnAssistantBlock`).
- **Interactive `startup enable` and `pichamber version`.** In an interactive terminal with no setup flags, `pichamber startup enable` now walks through access (`This machine only` / `Local network` / `Custom bind address`), port (1–65535 validated), authentication (`Use configured password` / `Enter a password` with confirmation / `Generate a secure password` / `No password` when local), and a final confirmation before installing the native service. Flag-driven, non-TTY, `--quiet`, and `--json` runs stay non-interactive. Re-running enable rewrites and restarts the systemd unit (`daemon-reload` + `enable` + `restart`) so new settings take effect instead of requiring a manual restart. Adds `pichamber version` (and `--version`) that prints the installed package version and supports `--json` (`bin/cli`, `cli-args`, `commands-startup`, `cli-startup`, `DOCUMENTATION.md`).
- **Web updates use the correct Pi endpoint and a detached launcher.** The client now posts to `POST /api/pi/update-install` (was `/api/pichamber/update-install`) and the server validates the install is a trusted global package-manager copy before spawning a detached updater (`pichamber update --quiet`, `detached` + `stdio: ignore`). Container and systemd-hosted servers are refused with an actionable message instead of attempting an in-place replace (`#74`, `UpdateDialog`, `routes`, `package-manager`, `launchUpdateCommand`).
- **Directory focus no longer loops on Windows spellings.** The chrome bridge compares normalized path identities (slash style, drive-letter case, trailing separator) before writing the daemon focus back into `useDirectoryStore`, preventing an update loop between `C:\\repo` and `C:/repo/` (`AppEffects`, `normalizePath`).

## [0.7.1] - 2026-09-01

Composer, project, and desktop-auth polish after 0.7.0.

- **Thinking changes wait until send.** Composer thinking-level picks stay local until the next send, so mid-turn or idle picker changes no longer rewrite the active session (`apply-composer-thinking`).
- **Skills trust without a popup.** Opening a project no longer shows a trust dialog for skills; PiChamber projects are trusted automatically.
- **Worktree create stays in the background.** Creating a worktree shows global progress instead of blocking the composer, so you can keep chatting while checkout finishes (#66).
- **Desktop reload keeps the last host unlocked.** Reloading an Electron window reapplies the stored client token for the hydrated last runtime before the password gate runs (`restoreDesktopRelayRuntime`, #65).
- **Projects settings match other pages.** The Projects settings page follows the Providers/Skills layout, and the Settings nav no longer repeats the PiChamber heading (#63, #69).
- **UI polish.** Left sidebar border removed, tablet composer padding and header burger aligned with desktop, and the OpenAI logo shows for the `openai-codex` provider (#64).

## [0.7.0] - 2026-09-01

Streaming reliability and faster session startup.

- **Live turns survive reload.** Reopening a chat that is still running restores the working/tooling state from `getSession` (`isStreaming` / `lifecycle: 'busy'` plus in-flight tools) instead of showing a settled transcript until the next token.
- **Event stream stays attached.** Transport switches reconnect from the last accepted sequence without treating a disconnect as an empty session. Missed replay windows force-hydrate from an authoritative snapshot.
- **Remembered desktop host auth.** Reloading an existing Electron window reapplies the selected remote host URL and stored client token so a remembered password is not prompted again (`startup-url-selection`, `main.mjs`).
- **Warm sidebar catalog.** Stable session-list metadata is cached per runtime and restored as idle rows before directory lists return. Failed folder refreshes keep cached rows; authoritative empty lists persist an empty tombstone. Busy/retry and hydrated transcripts are never restored from cache (`pi-session-catalog-cache`).
- **Faster crowded folder lists.** `sessions.list` reads up to eight JSONL session files at a time in a directory. One unreadable or header-malformed file still fails that folder only.

## [0.6.0] - 2026-08-25

Worktree-aware sidebar and no-folder session fixes.

- **Worktree-specific busy indicator.** When a project has linked worktrees, the sidebar now shows the busy spinner on the exact worktree that is running. Collapsed projects aggregate activity on the project row; expanded projects show the spinner only on the primary checkout or the linked worktree that is actually busy. Single-project and no-worktree behavior is unchanged (`SessionSidebar` → `activeDirectoriesByProject`, `SidebarSpacesBar` per-worktree `AgentThinkingLoader`).
- **Sessions without a folder stay global.** Sessions created with “Don’t work in a folder” at literal `~` no longer leak into every registered project’s ownership bucket or focused catalog slice, so switching folders cannot retain or select an unrelated home session. `isKnownActiveSessionDirectory` and directory-ownership logic now scope correctly to authoritative known directories and global session home, with header location hiding the stale active project for home sessions (#59).
- **Electron update manifest verification handles multiple artifacts.** `verify-update-manifest.mjs` now finds the expected artifact by matching its URL among multiple `files` entries instead of requiring exactly one, fixing checksum validation for macOS `latest-mac.yml` which lists both DMG and ZIP.
- **Sidebar labeling.** “All sessions” is now labeled “All Folders” across the sidebar and docs; global/home sessions carry the neutral “No folder” shade and correct empty states when no folder is selected.

## [0.5.2] - 2026-08-25

Folder-scoped session reliability release.

- **Folder switching shows the correct sessions.** Home sessions no longer enter every registered project's ownership bucket or focused catalog slice, so changing folders cannot retain or select an unrelated home session.
- **Explicit no-folder sessions.** The new-session picker always offers "Don't work in a folder" at literal `~`, whether the runtime home is registered as a folder or not. The selection remains stable instead of snapping back to the active project.
- **All folders keeps global sessions accessible.** Sessions created at `~` appear only in All folders, carry a "No folder" secondary label, and use a neutral theme-aware background. Project views remain strictly folder-owned.
- **Release integrity.** Desktop release jobs independently verify macOS, Windows, and Linux updater-manifest checksums against their generated artifacts. The npm job publishes the exact attached tarball and verifies its SHA-512 integrity, SHA-1 shasum, and downloaded registry bytes.

## [0.5.1] - 2026-08-25

Focused composer and reload reliability release.

- **Repository-free sessions.** The new-session folder picker now offers "Don't work in a repository", creates the session in the connected runtime's home directory, and shows those home sessions in every project folder. Literal `~` and expanded-home catalog entries merge without duplicate rows.
- **Reload restores context.** Reloading the web or desktop renderer preserves the selected runtime and its last active session instead of reverting to Local server. Runtime endpoint persistence remains credential-free, and Capacitor mobile keeps its existing validated restore flow.
- **Safe worktree names.** Small-model utility inference now runs in an isolated Pi text-transformation session without coding-agent instructions, repository context, skills, extensions, templates, or tools. Worktree naming accepts only a complete lowercase ASCII hyphenated slug within 48 characters; conversational or malformed replies fall back to the deterministic task-derived name.

## [0.5.0] - 2026-08-24

Pi extension release: existing extensions now run inside PiChamber's session daemon, their commands and standard UI prompts work across clients, and extensions can add native cards, panels, forms, and sandboxed app views to the workspace.

- **Pi extensions run in PiChamber.** The session daemon loads global and trusted project extensions through Pi's standard discovery flow. Registered tools, commands, lifecycle hooks, prompt modifications, and session state work without a PiChamber-specific dependency; child-process extensions resolve the real `pi-coding-agent` binary inside the detached daemon (`session-daemon`, `extension-bridge`).
- **Extension dialogs and live UI.** Standard `ctx.ui` select, confirm, input, editor, notification, status, and widget calls render in web, desktop, hosted mobile, and Capacitor clients. PiChamber's versioned extension protocol adds validated markdown, key-value, list, table, progress, badge, and code cards; reconnect-safe live panels; structured forms; command actions; and script-only sandboxed app views (`extension-protocol`, `extension-ui`, `ExtensionDialogOverlay`, `ExtensionStatusWidgets`, `ExtensionMessageCard`, `ExtensionPanelDock`, `ExtensionAppSurfaces`).
- **Extension commands in the composer.** Registered slash commands appear in autocomplete and dispatch to their extension with arguments. Settings can pin commands as composer buttons and bind global shortcuts without shadowing built-in shortcuts (`CommandAutocomplete`, `ComposerCommandTriggers`, `CommandTriggersSettings`).
- **Extension state stays in sync.** Model and thinking-level changes made by commands such as `/balance` or `/juicer` now update the composer instead of being overwritten by stale local selection. Dialog responses are validated, ANSI and truecolor dialog content is normalized on mobile, notifications appear as toasts and transcript cards, and extension listings expose opaque IDs rather than host paths (`model-selection-sync`, `ansi`, `extension-bridge`).
- **Faster worktree switching.** Changing sessions or worktrees no longer recreates the project list. Filtered worktree views remove redundant group headers and indentation, while draft target controls and pending-change details are more compact (`useProjectsStore`, `SidebarProjectsList`, `SidebarSpacesBar`, `DraftTargetSelectors`, `PendingChangesBar`).
- **Mobile composer polish.** Speech recording no longer shows a timer that crowds the mobile composer, and long model and thinking-level labels use tighter limits (`ComposerVoiceInput`, `ModelControls`, `ThinkingLevelControl`).
- **Pi-native cleanup.** The remaining internal OpenCode compatibility clients, status/config helpers, route aliases, and fallback contracts have been removed. PiChamber now uses the Pi-native session, settings, Git, and runtime paths directly.
- **Release integrity.** npm publishing now publishes the exact tarball attached to the GitHub Release, then verifies its SHA-512 integrity and SHA-1 shasum against npm metadata and the registry download before attaching it (`release.yml`).

## [0.4.0] - 2026-08-24

Worktree, composer, skills and voice release: linked Git worktrees become first-class peers, branch checkout is deferred until send, Pi skill reads render as navigation rows, and final-only speech dictation ships with waveform feedback.

- **Git worktree integration.** Linked worktrees are auto-discovered via `git worktree list --porcelain` regardless of filesystem location and owned by their registered project — never as separate projects. The composer folder picker and sidebar show them as indented branch rows under the owning project; selecting one filters sessions and targets `New session` without registering another project. A new `Current checkout` / `New worktree` composer mode treats the selected branch as `Start from`, derives a `pichamber/<name>` branch with the configured small model (local slug fallback, never blocking), creates the worktree without mutating the source checkout, waits for `setup-ready` (`Creating worktree…` → `Checking out files…` → `Setting up project…` → `Starting session…`), then creates and sends against the server-confirmed directory. Failures preserve the draft and prompt and never fall back to the source checkout. Server adds `GET /api/git/worktrees`, `POST /api/git/worktrees/validate`, `POST /api/git/worktrees`, `GET /api/git/worktrees/bootstrap-status` and `POST /api/pi/small-model/generate` (Pi-native one-shot, no tools/persistence); `getWorktrees` now exposes `isPrimary`/`detached`/`locked`/`prunable` and throws on failure; runtime-scoped discovery is coalesced, visibility-bounded and preserves the previous list on failure (`useWorktreeStore`, `worktree-discovery`, `pi-session-catalog-feeder`, `known-session-directories`, `sessionOwnership`, `projectResolution`, `useConfigStore`, `ChatInput`, `small-model-generation`).
- **Composer defers branch checkout until send.** Picking a different branch now records a directory-and-runtime-scoped draft intent without touching Git; the first send confirms surrounding sessions and completes checkout with `expectedCurrent` + `localOnly` preconditions before creating the session, with a dedicated confirmation dialog when other local branches would be disrupted (`useDraftTarget`, `useDraftBranchCheckout`, `DraftBranchCheckoutDialog`, `DraftTargetSelectors`, `session-ui-store`).
- **Pi skill reads render as navigation rows.** `skill` tool calls render as compact navigation rows like file reads, with pill alignment and hidden `id`, improving skill discoverability on desktop and mobile (`skillToolPresentation`, `ProgressiveGroup`).
- **Final-only speech dictation.** Composer gains hold-to-talk dictation with final-only transcripts, canvas waveform visualizer, audio worklet capture, thinking-level slider and mobile footer integration; no provider is required beyond the model catalog (`dictation-client`, `audio-capture`, `audio-worklet`, `ComposerVoiceButton`/`Visualizer`/`Input`, `DictationSettings`). Includes `fix(ui): keep dictation composer height stable`, `perf(ui): scroll dictation waveform on canvas`, and `feat(ui): align dictation controls with composer footer`.
- **Remote development WebSocket fix.** Authenticated dev WebSockets are now proxied through the PiChamber server so HMR and provider streams remain authenticated on remote hosts (`fix(web): proxy authenticated dev websockets`).
- **Mobile parity fixes for v0.3.2 / v0.3.3.** Subtask "Open subtask session" now closes the sessions sheet and workspace drawer on dedicated mobile after switching sessions (`MobileApp`, `mobileAppContext`, `MessageBody`); fork-family accent paints a 3px solid `borderLeft` on phone/tablet where the previous 11% wash was invisible against `bg-sidebar` (`forkFamilyColor`, `SessionNodeItem`); persisted `ui-store` v16→17 re-sanitizes `contextPanelByDirectory` and strips `chat` from `contextRailOrder` for stale hosted-mobile tablet tabs (`useUIStore`); four `Refresh catalog` / `Refresh providers` buttons use `size="sm"` on mobile to hit the 36px touch target (`ProvidersPage`).
- **Polish.** Sticky folder label deduplication, fork session prompting and mobile color fixes, and docs for Git worktree and small-model generation.

## [0.3.3] - 2026-08-22

Hotfix for the 0.3.2 desktop startup crash.

- **Fixes immediate Electron crash on every platform.** 0.3.2 shipped a regression in the retry-limit feature: the session daemon imported the PiChamber data-root from `../pichamber-data-dir.js` instead of `../../pichamber-data-dir.js`, so the Electron main process (and the web server) failed at startup with `ERR_MODULE_NOT_FOUND`. The import is now correctly resolved and the desktop app again starts and serves the Pi session daemon (`session-daemon`). Re-bundle the Electron main (`bundle:main`) after this change; installed 0.3.2 users should update to 0.3.3 via `pichamber update` or the auto-updater.

## [0.3.2] - 2026-08-22

Remote access and consistency release: remote terminal works over LAN/tunnel again, agent run duration is identical on every device, desktop clients can pair new devices, and Cloudflare Tunnel external access ships end to end.

- **Remote terminal WebSocket fix.** Browser WebSocket upgrades cannot send headers, so remote clients mint a 60-second `oc_url_token`; the server's URL-token gate had no WebSocket allowlist, so every non-local terminal connection failed with "HTTP Authentication failed". `/api/terminal/ws` is now an explicit URL-token WebSocket path (still origin-checked, still scoped, unknown upgrade paths still rejected), restoring remote terminals over direct LAN, reverse proxy, relay, and tunnel (`ui-auth`, `terminalApi`).
- **Consistent agent working duration across devices.** The daemon now owns the authoritative turn start: `session.lifecycle` busy/retry events, snapshots, and session details carry `runStartedAt` plus `serverNow`, and clients derive elapsed time from the server clock offset instead of local observation. Opening the same running session on a second device (or after reload/reconnect) shows the same duration instead of restarting from zero; completed/failed/interrupted turns settle identically everywhere (`session-daemon`, `routes`, `protocol`, `session-activity-timing`, `pi-session-store`).
- **User-configurable default retry limit.** Sessions settings gains a Default retry limit control (0–10 retries, default 3) persisted in the PiChamber sidecar and applied to new sessions through Pi's `retry.maxRetries`; explicit per-run values keep precedence. 0 disables automatic retries (`settings-store`, `session-daemon`, `DefaultsSettings`).
- **Cloudflare Tunnel external access.** A server-owned tunnel manager wires the previously unwired Cloudflare provider into the live server: quick, managed-remote (token + hostname), and managed-local modes with status, start/stop, doctor diagnostics, one-time bootstrap connect links, and secret handling that stores tunnel tokens mode-`0600`, reports only presence booleans, and redacts everything else. Routes are authenticated; docs cover setup, required Cloudflare token permissions, and systemd (`tunnel-service`, `server/index.js`, `install.mdx`).
- **Desktop clients can pair new devices.** Trusted paired-desktop client tokens may now create short-lived pairing tickets through a narrowly scoped auth path (separate from general device management, which stays UI-session/desktop-local only). Tickets stay one-time, time-limited, revocable, and rate-limited on redeem; mobile and other client kinds remain blocked from creating pairings (`core-routes`).
- **Forked sessions render like normal sessions.** The sidebar drops the nested fork tree and its dropdown: every session sits in the unified recency order, and fork families are identified by a deterministic per-family accent color derived from the family root ID — stable across clients, reloads, and restarts (`useSessionGrouping`, `SessionNodeItem`, `forkFamilyColor`).
- **Sidebar archive on touch devices.** The hover archive action is now desktop-only; tablets and phones manage archive/delete through the press-and-hold context menu, preventing accidental archives from ordinary taps (`sessionQuickActions`, `SessionSidebar`).
- **Provider model visibility fixes.** Show all / Hide all publish immediately and deduplicate reliably (rows re-render via the shared hidden-models check), and the Refresh catalog button is now an accessible icon button with loading state, disabled state, and success/error feedback (`ProvidersPage`, `useUIStore`).
- **Snippet editor opens in Write mode.** New snippet creation defaults to the Write tab; existing snippets still open in Preview and in-progress mode choices are never overwritten while editing (`SnippetMarkdownEditor`, `SnippetsPage`).
- **Root VPS installs work out of the box.** On Linux, root installations register a system systemd unit (`/etc/systemd/system/pichamber.service`, `multi-user.target`) instead of a user unit needing lingering, so `pichamber startup enable` survives reboot under root; user installs are unchanged. `pichamber update` restarts whichever scope is active and keeps configuration, env files, and data intact (`cli-startup`, `commands-update`).
- **Side panel chat removed.** The experimental "Open in Side Panel" surface, embedded chat iframe plumbing, and related theme/router guards are deleted; subtask links navigate in place and stale persisted panel state migrates away (`ContextPanel`, `useUIStore` v16, `useRouter`).

## [0.3.1] - 2026-08-22

Stability and cross-device reliability release. No new surfaces — every change is a targeted fix for live streaming, retry, revert, and daemon recovery discovered immediately after 0.3.0.

- **Cross-device stream recovery.** `EventSource` now resumes from the last accepted sequence after reconnect, so a session started on desktop rehydrates correctly on a second tab or phone without orphaning live messages. Native `EventSource` transport stays outside CapacitorHttp (which buffers SSE), and WKWebView dead-connection retention is handled by replacing rather than reusing the stalled stream. Hydrate vs. live merging was reworked so a newer fetch does not erase the partial transcript of a restarted client (`pi-session-store`, `transport`, `supervisor`, `session-daemon`).
- **Live message tree IDs are now alias-resolved.** Hydrated transcripts already carry Pi `entry.id`; live `message_start` synth IDs (`user-<session>-<n>` / `assistant-<session>-<n>`) are now mapped to the persisted entry ID by object identity at `message_end` and resolved before navigation/fork. The mapping is cwd+session scoped, survives idle daemon disposal, and clears on deletion/shutdown. Fixes revert/retry on messages created after the last hydrate and prevents synthetic parent references from orphaning turns in a second tab (`message-entry-aliases`, `session-daemon`, `session-ui-store`).
- **Pi retry lifecycle ownership.** The daemon is the single owner of the retry state: transient provider errors (`SessionRetry`, `continuing: true`) keep the session in `retry` instead of flipping to `error`, `session.lifecycle: retry` now carries `{ attempt, next, message }`, and the server projects the same retry meta on snapshots and event frames. The client treats `retry` as a live continuation so tool calls and follow-ups survive the retry window (`session-daemon`, `routes`, `protocol`, `event-reducer`).
- **Retry and tool continuation rendering.** The chat overlay keeps `retry` visible through Pi's preparatory `busy` frame and the next `assistant.message.start`, clearing only on accepted text/thinking/tool output. Error-ended assistants remain the active stream until a retry or terminal lifecycle clears the footer. The assistant working-state and `Retry` banner copy are corrected (`Retrying after an error:`), `continuing` assistant content is rendered without a spurious retry badge, and catalog/turn records upsert stubs so the sidebar never drops the session during a retry (`event-reducer`, `pi-session-catalog`, `applyRetryOverlay`, `MessageList`, `assistantWorkingState`, `sync-context`).
- **Revert restore is now durable.** The per-message revert control is hidden on the newest message (no-op navigation) while fork stays available. Partial restores keep the original pre-revert leaf; navigation state clears only after the abandoned branch is fully restored, so a second restore no longer goes backward. `restore`/`redo` now reject on failure and the `RevertedMessageDock` surfaces the error via toast instead of silently swallowing it. Companion alias fix for live assistant turns described above (`session-ui-store`, `session-actions`, `MessageRevertAction`, `message-entry-aliases`).
- **Windows daemon timeout recovery.** The supervisor treats `DAEMON_TIMEOUT`/`DAEMON_START_TIMEOUT` as recoverable, and the store's `reportError` keeps a transport-owned backoff loop alive even when the initial runtime probe failed before the SSE stream attached. On reconnect the store triggers an authoritative bootstrap instead of treating the stream itself as state, preventing Windows users from getting stuck in `error` after a slow daemon start (`supervisor`, `pi-session-store`, `pi-session-connection`).
- **Cross-tab retry alias is now sticky.** Canonicalizes streaming assistant IDs and mutation metadata to the hydrated Pi entry ID so a resumed SSE alias renders in a second tab. Resumed assistants whose synthetic user parent predates the second tab's cursor are attached to the latest hydrated user turn, eliminating orphans. Retry survives `busy`→`assistant.message.start`→`error`→`retry` transitions correctly; added regression coverage for alias fix and orphan prevention (`event-reducer`, `suspend-live-tail-records`).

## [0.3.0] - 2026-08-21

This release ships per-message branching, rebuilds Providers, Skills, and
Snippets around a unified grid and detail pattern, and makes tunneling and
settings honest about what PiChamber actually supports.

- **Per-message revert and fork with timeline.** Any user message can be
  reverted or forked from its own action menu. Reverted messages are tracked
  per-message with a dedicated dock and a `TimelineDialog` showing the full
  branch. Forking creates a durable server-side branch (real Git branch) with
  a forked title, and navigation intent keeps blank/draft routing predictable.
  Server work lives in `session-daemon` and `protocol`, with
  `revert-navigation-store`, `pi-session-store`, and `session-ui-store`
  owning the client state.
- **Providers catalog rebuilt.** List + sidebar is now grid `ProviderCard`s
  with auth-first sort, search, refresh, and a detail drill-down. Per-model
  default variant is set inline, catalog refresh and connected-state handling
  are fixed, and Settings polish removes stale polling. `ProvidersSidebar` is
  removed.
- **Skills catalog rebuilt.** Grid `SkillCard`s with project-first sort,
  markdown detail view, pill left-aligned and `id` hidden, and markdown
  loading for content. Mobile `/skill` now works: case-insensitive hint
  matching, warm catalog load, and touch-friendly autocomplete. `SkillsSidebar`
  is removed.
- **Snippets rebuilt.** Grid `SnippetCard`s with browse + full-page
  `SnippetMarkdownEditor`, consolidated to a single kind (the kind selector is
  gone), and the trigger is rewired from `/` to `#` with direct content
  expansion. Mobile `SkillAutocomplete`/`SnippetAutocomplete` and
  `ThinkingLevelControl` touch handling are fixed.
- **Settings cleanup.** Utility prompts are renamed/hidden, tunnel provider is
  renamed and hidden to match the Cloudflare-only reality, Behavior and Skills
  now edit markdown, usage reporting is removed, mobile headers are deduped,
  settings padding and `SettingsPageLayout` are fixed, and PiChamber visual
  and defaults panes are tuned. Mobile Settings adds a Remote Servers card and
  sidebar cleanup; desktop context chart on the rail gets a mobile-style hover
  with git changed-files count interpolation (`ContextProgressIcon`,
  `ContextUsageDisplay`).
- **Tunnels: Cloudflare only (breaking).** `ngrok` is removed entirely:
  `ngrok-tunnel.js`, tests, provider, types, `package-manager` helpers, and
  `cli-tunnel-capabilities` ngrok paths are deleted. `TunnelSettings`,
  `DOCS/references`, and research notes now document Cloudflare as the sole
  provider. If you relied on `ngrok`, reconfigure to Cloudflare (`cloudflared`)
  before upgrading.
- **Desktop and rail polish.** Context rail tooltip interpolates live git
  changed-file counts, header/titlebar controls are aligned (collapsed-sidebar
  toggle matches row-mates, spacer fixes), and prompt navigator rail count is
  corrected.
- **Mobile and drawer reliability.** Directory explorer no longer auto-focuses
  on mobile (prevents keyboard pop), drawer swipe can close from anywhere with
  shared `gestureMath` fixes, thinking slider stays interactive while
  dragging, and `ChatInput`/`ComposerEditor` focus handling is tightened.
- **Session drafts that stay put.** New-session drafts are preserved across
  folder changes and runtime switches, blank draft navigation intent is
  documented and tested (`session-intent`), and `ArchiveView`/`SidebarHeader`
  routing handles drafts consistently.
- **Pi provider resilience.** Session daemon now handles the Pi SDK provider
  retry lifecycle correctly so transient provider errors no longer stick
  sessions in failed state, with daemon tests.
- **Docs and housekeeping.** README previews and “why PiChamber” refreshed,
  revert and external tunnel behavior clarified, lint (`prefer-const`,
  `require-imports`, `exhaustive-deps`) cleaned, and patch releases bundled for
  provider/skill/snippet polish.

## [0.2.2] - 2026-08-20

This release polishes mobile and tablet interaction, smooths drawer and
sidebar motion, and removes a few nagging UI leftovers.

- Mobile drawers now open from edge swipes and close reliably with
  velocity-aware gestures; accidental opens while scrolling are suppressed.
  Shared gesture math and drawer surface handling are extracted and covered
  by unit tests.
- Tablet header now toggles workspace tabs directly (Changes / Files /
  Terminal / Notes) on the right, with tap-to-close on the active tab.
  Collapsed-sidebar overlap is fixed with header spacers, and the
  context-usage ring is visible like on phones.
- Tablet composer now matches desktop detail: full model/branch/project
  names (no 20/26-char truncation), full pending-changes and task text, and
  desktop draft selectors/sheets.
- Performance: titlebar no longer flushes layout on sidebar toggle, and
  drawer and tablet sidebar interactions are throttled for smoother frames.
- Phone composer truncates long model/project (20 chars) and branch
  (26 chars) labels to keep the input readable, condenses the pending-changes
  pill to icon + diff on mobile, and makes the thinking-level slider
  draggable on touch without selecting nearby text.
- Mobile workspace drawer is now fullscreen with an explicit close button
  in the header.
- Session menus, the header session menu, and the bulk action bar no longer
  show Share or Move to folder.
- Adding a folder no longer auto-pops on launch or instance/runtime switch;
  the directory dialog opens only from explicit user action (sidebar,
  command palette, settings) and dismisses when the runtime changes.
- Android adds a debug variant (`com.pichamber.app.debug`,
  "PiChamber - Debug" with `-debug` version suffix) that can be installed
  side-by-side with the release build for development.

## [0.2.1] - 2026-08-19

This release restores responsive, complete chat rendering while making session
startup and reconnect behavior more reliable.

- Tool cards are no longer hidden after dense turns. Interrupted persisted tool
  calls render as explicit errors, while genuinely active calls remain running.
- Reopening or switching sessions coalesces overlapping open and hydrate work,
  preserves authoritative in-flight tool state, and avoids transient runtime
  conflicts being reported as a disconnected server.
- The Pi session daemon warms after HTTP starts listening, and concurrent
  settings and Git branch loads now share one request.
- Closed timelines, hidden diff panels, and collapsed historical Task tools no
  longer hydrate or subscribe to session data they cannot display.
- Update polling waits for session bootstrap, and Strict Mode remounts continue
  to share the existing event-stream owner.
- Production streaming profiling now drives the authenticated browser API,
  supports Windows-hosted Chrome profiling a WSL server, and validates
  virtualized histories through visible character growth.

## [0.2.0] - 2026-08-19

This release makes the server install path honest: you install and upgrade
`@pi-chamber/web` through the package manager that owns it. It also fixes
session titles, sidebar motion, and a few desktop and tablet layout bugs.

- Server install is package-manager only. The curl `scripts/install.sh`
  wrapper is gone. Docs recommend `bun add -g @pi-chamber/web`, with npm,
  pnpm, and yarn examples.
- `pichamber update` upgrades only the global install that owns the running
  CLI, and restarts a Linux user systemd unit instead of spawning a second
  server on the same port. Startup help documents `--lan`, `--port`, and
  `--ui-password`.
- Remote sessions keep the title Pi already stored, instead of falling back
  to a generated label after reconnect or catalog refresh.
- The Electron window menu stays usable while the sessions sidebar is open.
- Closing the sessions panel now shrinks in lockstep with the header, so the
  title no longer slides the wrong way first.
- Tablets use desktop chrome instead of the phone sheet layout. The composer
  stays pinned in the chat footer.

## [0.1.9] - 2026-08-19

This release improves runtime switching and makes the native mobile client
usable on direct LAN connections.

- Runtime switches now reset host-specific paths, projects, sessions, routes,
  and caches before the authenticated target runtime boots, preventing
  Windows-to-WSL path leakage and stale session requests.
- First session attachment reuses its health and session-list results, while
  background catalog work waits until the focused chat is ready.
- Native Capacitor clients use authenticated `EventSource` for direct LAN Pi
  event streams instead of the buffered HTTP adapter.
- Mobile Instances can export a bounded, redacted diagnostics log for stream,
  connection, health, and send failures.
- Mobile sidebar project rows are tighter, and the global mobile overflow rule
  no longer turns clipped UI elements into nested scroll containers.

## [0.1.8] - 2026-08-18

This release publishes the PiChamber server/CLI to npm as `@pi-chamber/web`.

- Install with `npm install -g @pi-chamber/web` or the existing curl installer. The command is still `pichamber`.
- `pichamber update` and desktop SSH-managed installs use that package. npm `latest` is trusted only when the registry repository is RyderAsKing/PiChamber.
- Desktop installers stay on GitHub Releases. npm publish is opt-in on the Release workflow (`publish_npm` plus the `NPM_TOKEN` secret).

## [0.1.7] - 2026-08-18

This release lets phones reach a desktop on the same Wi-Fi, keeps streaming
cheap on long chats, and cleans up chat and session chrome.

- Android phones on the same network as a PiChamber desktop can connect:
  pairing advertises the real LAN address, packaged app origins are allowed
  for CORS, and launcher/splash art uses the PiChamber mark.
- Live replies no longer rebuild the whole transcript on every token. Folded
  history uses **Load older history** and **Load all history** instead of a
  picker.
- Non-working message actions are gone. Session rename and history navigation
  stay put when older turns appear.
- Changes covers Pi-native last-turn edits and Git branch diffs. Embedded
  quick-chat loads against the panel's project instead of guessing.
- Native app menus on Windows and Linux open from the title-bar control.

## [0.1.6] - 2026-08-18

This release updates the dedicated mobile UI and enables Android APK builds
on version-tag releases.

- Dedicated mobile gets a sessions drawer, workspace drawer, full stacked
  composer, and folder-style project list with working Add folder.
- Tapping a project folder keeps the sessions drawer open while that folder's
  session loads, so another session can still be chosen. Tapping Settings
  closes the drawer.
- Files browsing uses full-width rows and an Up one level control. Sidebar
  type and icons are denser.
- Tagged GitHub releases now build and upload a signed Android APK (and AAB)
  instead of skipping mobile artifacts by default.

## [0.1.5] - 2026-08-18

This release keeps long chats cheaper to keep on screen, and makes adding a
folder a single, obvious action.

- Long sessions stay smoother by reusing settled transcript records, showing
  compact rows for older turns, and stubbing large tool bodies until you
  expand them. Scrolling to a folded message restores the full turn.
- Settings → General → Diagnostics can turn on a this-browser-only Performance
  overlay for frame time, long tasks, and existing render counters. It stays
  off by default and does not sync to other devices.
- Adding a folder is driven by the path field: Browse picks a location without
  adding it, and **Add folder** is the only primary action. Clone lives in the
  directory list header. Already-added folders stay openable so a nested folder
  can still be added. On Windows, Browse uses the modern folder picker.

## [0.1.4] - 2026-08-18

This release keeps long chats readable while they stream, and restores session
history that could vanish after a few turns.

- Older session history no longer disappears after sending a message once a
  chat is long enough to virtualize. The transcript stays on screen, and
  switching sessions still uses the existing cache.
- Streaming replies stay smoother: token updates are batched per frame,
  settled markdown is left alone, and live prose wraps at the full chat
  width instead of a narrow strip.
- Thinking traces collapse when the answer or a tool starts, stay cheap
  while they stream, and can be collapsed by default. Those reasoning
  preferences now persist across reloads.
- Settings layout and project spacing are tighter, and About PiChamber is
  available from the app.

## [0.1.3] - 2026-08-18

This release makes everyday PiChamber use feel calmer and more predictable: the
composer takes up less space, model choices are easier to understand, and
returning to an older chat keeps using the model that chat was built with.

- The composer now uses a cleaner stacked layout with the model and thinking
  controls kept together, while removing the unused desktop focus-mode control.
- Thinking is now presented as a larger, discrete slider with clear minimum and
  maximum labels. The available levels follow the selected Pi model.
- New-session thinking defaults can be saved per model, so different providers
  can keep their own preferred level.
- Reopening an existing chat restores its most recently used model and thinking
  level instead of inheriting whichever model was selected most recently
  elsewhere. You can still change either choice manually.
- Model pickers now use the configured-provider catalog and can hide models
  that should not appear in everyday selection lists.
- Project settings use the shared model picker, with a more consistent layout
  for choosing a project's default model.
- Session and project navigation is quieter and more compact, with cleaner
  sidebar spacing, simpler session rows, and a unified Git/Changes rail.
- Live conversations stream more smoothly, with less duplicate text while
  responses arrive and better preservation of the active chat during switches.
- Incomplete project actions no longer trigger premature validation errors while
  they are still being filled in.

## [0.1.2] - 2026-08-17

Desktop 0.1.2 is a Windows-focused reliability cut. Packaged Electron should get past Loading, show models, and talk to the Pi session daemon on native Windows.

- First launch with no project selected marks the Pi session cluster `ready` with an empty folder focus instead of staying on Loading.
- A leftover empty or unreadable Pi daemon lock is retried and stolen instead of failing `/api/pi/*` with `DAEMON_LOCK_UNAVAILABLE`.
- Built-in providers that are not in `models.json` return `config: null` instead of HTTP 400, so Settings/Providers no longer fail on amazon-bedrock, openrouter, or opencode-go.
- Model pickers (including Small Model) list every catalog provider that has models, including unauthenticated ones, so you can browse before login. The leftover `/api/small-model` call is gone.
- Windows Pi session directories match the Pi SDK cwd encoding, including drive letters and Git Bash/MSYS/Cygwin/WSL `/c/...` paths, so PiChamber and the Pi CLI share the same JSONL sessions.
- The private daemon listens and connects over a Windows named pipe with IPC `path` options. Sidecar `chmod` failures on Windows no longer prevent the daemon from recording ready/failure state.
- Unpackaged `electron:dev` pins a real semver onto `app.setVersion` before `electron-updater` constructs, so host Electron version `0.0` no longer crashes the desktop shell.

## [0.1.1] - 2026-08-17

- Desktop and web packaged icons now use the PiChamber hexagon-and-pi mark instead of the inherited OpenChamber cube.
- Packaged Electron no longer blocks filesystem fetches from `pichamber-ui://app` (CORS now allows the workspace directory header), and the Pi session daemon is spawned as Node so Windows desktop no longer sticks on Loading with `/api/pi/*` 400s.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-08-17

First public **PiChamber** release. This cut ships **Electron desktop** only (macOS, Windows, Linux AppImage). The npm CLI package and native mobile apps are not published yet.

### Why this exists

PiChamber is a community fork of [OpenChamber](https://github.com/openchamber/openchamber). OpenChamber proved that a coding-agent workspace can live on the desktop, in the browser, and on a machine you reach from anywhere. The product direction here is different: **a GUI and remote-hosting surface for [Pi Coding Agent](https://pi.dev)**, not another OpenCode wrapper.

People love Pi because it stays small. The agent, the session files, the skills, the prompts, and the config all belong to Pi. The missing piece was a serious remote UI: something that feels like OpenChamber, but talks to Pi, so you can run and supervise that same agent from your desk or from another device.

That is the whole bet. Keep Pi's minimalism. Add the "use it from anywhere" layer OpenChamber already solved well. Do not drag OpenCode's runtime, catalog, or product vocabulary along for the ride.

Desktop starts the PiChamber backend **in-process** and runs a **Pi-native session daemon**. There is no sidecar OpenCode binary and no separately installed Pi CLI required for the app to work. Sessions, models, providers, skills, prompt templates, and `AGENTS.md` are Pi's. Pairing, auth, Git, files, terminal, and the shell around them are PiChamber's.

### What comes next

A later release will add an **extensions GUI** that follows Pi's own extension model, instead of inventing a second plugin system. Native extensions stay off in this build until that security and UI contract exists.

### The UI was rebuilt

The first Pi cutover unmounted the OpenChamber workspace and briefly shipped a stripped prototype. This release puts a **full workspace back on Pi**: session sidebar, composer, settings, files, Git, terminal, and the context rail, all talking to `/api/pi/*` instead of OpenCode.

That was not a reskin. Session truth moved to a Pi session store and a live session catalog. The sidebar, streaming chat, loaders, deep links, and default theme were redone around that catalog. Git and Changes sit on one rail. Streaming no longer stutters duplicate characters or paints the wrong transcript on switch. The default look is a new PiChamber theme; startup uses a shimmer loader instead of a dead chrome flash.

### What was removed

These OpenCode-era product surfaces are gone on purpose. They depended on a runtime Pi does not have, or they fought Pi's own resource model:

- OpenCode as a managed process, bundled CLI, generic API proxy, SDK in the browser, and all `/api/opencode/*` upgrade/health routes
- VS Code extension host (`packages/vscode`)
- Goal Mode, Plan Mode, pinned/reinjected context, session assist, auto-review, and multi-run/fusion
- Managed worktrees as an OpenCode-owned feature
- Scheduled tasks and `.agents/loops` scheduling (UI, server, CLI, and Electron shutdown checks)
- Agent/session-control CLI commands (`session`, `schedule`, and other OpenCode control paths)
- OpenCode skill-catalog installer and Git/ZIP skill copy-into-project flow
- OpenCode prompt optimizer and response-style settings
- Voice, dictation, and TTS (local and cloud)
- Quota / usage dashboard tied to the old runtime
- MCP, agents, commands, and plugins settings pages (hidden and unwired; not a Pi surface yet)
- Separate OpenCode in-app upgrade toasts, routes, and binary upgrade capability
- Event realtime-proxy path, and unused tunnel/relay host orchestration that was never wired into the Pi daemon server
- Floating work-status sidebar and "recent activity" sidebar section
- Split Git/Changes toggle and the unused PR surface in the context rail
- Non-English UI locales (de, fr, ja, ko, pl, pt-BR, uk, es, zh-CN, zh-TW) and the language picker; the app is English-only for this cut
- Localized docs that would have described the old OpenCode product incorrectly

OpenChamber settings, sessions, and `~/.config/openchamber` are **not migrated**. Pi owns `~/.pi/agent/`. PiChamber-owned files live under `~/.config/pichamber`.

### How it was optimized

The port was used to make the app smaller and the live path cheaper, not only to swap the agent:

- About **50k lines** of dead code, unused exports, and orphan modules removed after the runtime cutover
- Production UI no longer ships an OpenCode SDK chunk
- i18n collapsed to a single English locale instead of shipping eleven locale bundles
- Live **session catalog** owns sidebar membership and status per directory, with bounded in-flight refreshes, so project/worktree switches do not reload from cold global state
- Topic-isolated session notifiers so chat, sidebar, and other subscribers do not share one coarse store ping
- Streaming markdown chunking and turn-timing without overlapping delta stutter
- Daemon recovery from a dead assistant stream without sticking the session; directory event streams no longer rewind on reconnect
- React Compiler babel pass is opt-in (it was costing a large share of production UI build time)
- Workspace builds run in parallel with a cached UI type-check
- Attachments are temp-path files for Pi tools instead of inline base64 that bloated context
- URL-token auth narrowed to the Pi event stream; other routes stay on the bearer boundary
- Headless `pichamber update` installs before restart and refuses unsafe in-container replacement; Electron still owns its own updater; there is no third OpenCode-upgrade channel

### This desktop cut

Identifiers are PiChamber (`PICHAMBER_*`, `pichamber-ui://`, `/api/pichamber/*`, `/api/pi/*`) with no OpenChamber aliases. MIT attribution to OpenChamber stays. Historical changelog entries below `1.18.1` are the inherited OpenChamber record, not claims about this Pi build.

## [1.18.1] - 2026-08-04

- **Providers:** signing in to an OAuth-only provider now actually completes — the browser login is stored and the provider list updates instead of remaining signed out. OAuth-only providers show a Connect flow instead of an API key form, and their models stay hidden until you are signed in.
- **Sessions:** archived sessions can now be restored to the active list — from the sidebar context menu, the archived-sessions page, or the bulk-selection bar — instead of only offering permanent deletion (thanks to @makeittech).
- Walkthrough: models without a working provider login no longer appear in the walkthrough picker, and Generate stays disabled until a usable model is selected instead of failing with a raw provider error.
- Providers: sign-ins that need extra details (such as GitHub Copilot Enterprise) now ask for them before opening the browser, and device codes come with a working copy button.
- Walkthrough: connecting to a server older than the app now says the server needs updating instead of showing a raw HTML parsing error, and the "Critical" tag is now "Key change" with a tooltip so it no longer reads as a problem found in your code.
- Chat: Ctrl/Cmd+L now adds the selected text to the chat input, or focuses it when nothing is selected; the toggle-sidebar shortcut moved to Ctrl/Cmd+Alt+L.
- Chat: a manually chosen model now stays selected after a delegated subtask finishes, instead of reverting to the agent's default model.
- Agents/CLI: sending a prompt that never reaches its session is now reported as failed, and an unavailable model, agent, or variant is rejected with a clear error before anything is created.
- Desktop/Linux: "Open in Terminal" no longer launches a non-terminal app that is set as the terminal launcher (thanks to @kydorn).

## [1.18.0] - 2026-08-04

- **Walkthrough:** a new guided walkthrough reorders a diff into a sequence of stops — the model groups related changes, explains what each one does, and orders them so each builds on the last. Start one from the Changes and pull-request views for uncommitted work, a branch against its base, or a pull request; nothing runs on its own. Walkthroughs are written in your interface language by default, and the panel can generate one in any other supported language.
- **Mobile/Tablet:** reworked the tablet and foldable layout around the phone's navigation — a persistent resizable sessions sidebar on the left, the workspace (Changes, Files, Terminal, Notes, MCP) as a resizable right sidebar, and app pages like settings and instances shown as centered dialogs. An open diff, edited file, or attached terminal now survives rotation.
- **Providers:** custom OpenAI-compatible providers can now be added and edited from Settings, including their endpoint, models, credentials, headers, and configuration scope (thanks to @makeittech).
- Performance: fixed Bun dependency chunking so the web app no longer downloads a single 18.5 MB vendor bundle at startup; heavy syntax highlighting, screenshot, diagram, editor, and image-conversion libraries now load only when needed (thanks to @makeittech).
- Performance: expanding projects with many worktrees no longer repeatedly reloads their session data.
- UI/Localization: added German interface translations and German documentation (thanks to @SGD-DEV).
- Mobile/Android: pairing QR codes can now be scanned on devices without Google Play Services; the camera closes as soon as a code is recognized, followed by a connection-in-progress screen.
- Mobile/Android: left and right drawer swipes can now start farther from the screen edge, outside Android's system Back gesture area.
- Sessions: launching OpenChamber from a directory other than your project (for example your home folder) no longer produces repeated "not a git repository" errors that could stop sessions and projects from loading (thanks to @makeittech).
- Sidebar: a worktree shared by more than one project no longer appears twice (thanks to @makeittech).
- Sidebar: session titles no longer clip at the ends of their rows.
- Git/Diff: opening a changed file now jumps its header directly to the top, and live updates refresh only files that actually changed while preserving the current review position. Saves from the built-in file editor update the diff too.
- Terminal: opening a terminal no longer waits for the terminal view to finish loading, and startup output is retained if it arrives before the view appears (thanks to @makeittech).
- Chat/Tools: Bash output now applies terminal control characters and strips ANSI formatting, preventing progress output and rewritten lines from appearing as raw escape sequences (thanks to @catan271).
- Chat: queued messages now retry after a temporary send failure or an interrupted turn instead of remaining stuck until another session update.
- Chat: prompts sent through the private relay no longer produce duplicate replies when the connection drops after OpenCode accepted the message, and a queued message already being sent is no longer included in another send.
- Settings/Skills: repository-local `.agents/skills` now appear for the active project (thanks to @makeittech).
- Settings/Skills: renaming a skill now preserves its instructions and supporting files; only skills in locations OpenChamber can safely rename show the action (thanks to @makeittech).
- Sessions: sessions in a newly created worktree now appear without restarting or refreshing the app.
- Agents/CLI: creating a session in a new worktree no longer reports a timeout while the worktree continues to be created in the background.
- Sessions: archiving and unarchiving now stays scoped to the current instance and workspace (thanks to @alexandrereyes).
- Usage: added DeepSeek quota tracking (thanks to @airtaxi).
- Usage: Kimi for Coding now calculates usage correctly when the provider reports either used or remaining quota (thanks to @makeittech).
- Desktop/Linux: terminals and OpenCode now start with the correct shell arguments in AppImage installs, fixing broken zsh startup (thanks to @makeittech).
- Files: browser clients now label file exports as downloads and no longer show the desktop-only reveal action (thanks to @makeittech).
- Chat: assistant messages no longer render active HTML.

## [1.17.2] - 2026-08-01

- **Mobile:** rebuilt the app navigation around two swipe drawers — a sessions drawer (left) with a cross-project tree, swipe actions to rename, archive, or delete sessions, and a workspace drawer (right) with Changes, Files, Terminal, Notes, and MCP tabs. Tapping the session title in the header switches recents from a compact overlay with live status indicators. Cold launches reopen the last active session and land on an explicit connect screen on failure instead of flashing an empty draft.
- **Desktop/Windows:** added Windows ARM64 support (thanks to @airtaxi).
- UI: a new OpenChamber theme (dark and light) is now the default, replacing the previous default theme.
- Desktop: the active session header now has a menu with rename, share, export, archive, delete, and copy-ID actions; share links copy to the clipboard automatically when created.
- Performance: opening the first session after startup is faster — background startup requests no longer queue ahead of the initial message load (thanks to @yulia-ivashko).
- Sessions: a root session can now be moved with all its sub-sessions into a new worktree directly from the header menu.
- Git/Diff: symlinks now appear as link entries in the diff view instead of showing their file content.
- Desktop/Linux: added a Window Controls Style setting to switch between classic rectangular buttons and macOS-style traffic lights (thanks to @kydorn).
- Files: added a global Auto-save setting under Settings → General; binary, PDF, and Office files are excluded from auto-save (thanks to @makeittech).
- Terminal: switching terminal tabs no longer rebuilds the connection from scratch on each open or switch (thanks to @makeittech).
- Sidebar: sessions with active agents now show a live activity indicator even when the sidebar is collapsed (thanks to @pascalandr).
- Usage: all Z.ai usage windows now appear in the usage view.
- Chat: tool descriptions now show the glob pattern when a tool's input uses one.
- Desktop: sticky session headers in the sidebar no longer blink or shift position during page transitions (thanks to @ChangeHow).
- Chat: clicking in the padding area of the composer now correctly places the cursor (thanks to @IbrahimKhan12).
- Chat: the `/` command menu no longer lists a skill twice when a command shares its name (thanks to @IbrahimKhan12).

## [1.17.1] - 2026-07-29

- **Chat tools:** Bash tool cards now show output before a command finishes, keep it in a fixed-height pane, and follow new lines until you scroll away. Long-running commands no longer remain at a 300-second duration, and their timers continue until they finish.
- System prompt optimization: added an optional Behavior setting that reduces OpenCode's built-in system prompt by about 40% for the build and plan agents; it applies after restarting OpenCode and is unsuitable for custom build or plan definitions.
- OpenCode: chats now recover when OpenCode stops responding during a response, and managed OpenCode no longer restarts repeatedly during a temporary connectivity failure.
- Desktop: bundled OpenCode no longer offers a separate update; it updates with OpenChamber (thanks to @yulia-ivashko).
- Chat: fully loaded histories no longer show "Load older" again after a refresh.
- Chat: messages removed by reverting no longer reappear after you send another message.
- Chat: slash-command starters now include text already entered in the draft as command arguments.
- Session goals: goals started from slash commands, including scheduled tasks, now use the command's expanded instructions.
- Usage: OpenAI business-account Codex usage now shows the configured spend limit (thanks to @jrandiny).
- Desktop/Linux: AppImage tray menus now include Show, Hide, and Close, and "Open in" shows system application icons (thanks to @makeittech).
- Settings: subpanels keep a visible vertical scrollbar and no longer show a horizontal scrollbar (thanks to @sergiofspedro).
- Mobile: image previews load when connected through the private relay.

## [1.17.0] - 2026-07-28

- **Context panel:** a new surface rail brings Changes, pull requests, files, terminal, notes, plans, previews, and side chats into one resizable panel. The pull-request surface now shows live checks and comments, and can attach failed checks or comments to a chat draft.
- **Desktop/Linux:** official AppImage releases for x64 and arm64, with in-app updates, frameless window controls, system tray minimize, launch at login, multi-window support, and “Open in” for discovered installed apps. Missing update manifests are treated as “no update” instead of a hard failure, and updater errors surface in About/sidebar (thanks to @BestSithInEU, @jibanez-staticduo, @makeittech).
- **Sidebar:** sessions are organized into Recent and project zones with worktree-grouped or flat views. Scheduled tasks, archived sessions, multi-run, and worktree management now open as full-page views from the sidebar.
- **Agents/CLI:** agents on managed local instances can now create, send to, fork, inspect, and wait for sessions; create isolated worktrees; and manage scheduled tasks through the OpenChamber tool. The CLI adds matching `session`, `schedule`, `projects`, and `models` commands, and a new Schedule a Task starter guides task setup from chat.
- Chat composer: prompts now render Markdown emphasis, attention lines, file and agent mentions, slash commands, snippets, attachment citations, and `~path` references directly while you type. File mentions can be edited in place, and the mobile composer grows with its content instead of using a separate fullscreen gesture.
- Desktop/Linux: fixed an intermittent freeze or crash while chats were streaming with the system tray enabled (thanks to @kydorn).
- Small Model: GitHub Copilot models now use their supported API, fixing summaries, goal audits, commit messages, and other Small Model actions for models that do not support Chat Completions (thanks to @jakoss).
- Chat: selecting text from Markdown code blocks now preserves the code fences, language, and surrounding block structure when adding it to the composer or starting a new session (thanks to @ChangeHow).
- Chat: code blocks no longer shift line layout or merge adjacent text while rendering, and copied code keeps its original text (thanks to @ChangeHow).
- Chat/Permissions: sending a message while a permission prompt is open now denies pending requests in the session and its subagents, then queues the message for the next turn (thanks to @tomzx).
- Chat/Subagents: subagent chats can be prompted when direct subagent prompting is enabled, even if the parent session has not loaded.
- Chat: jumping to messages in long conversations now lands on the intended message when earlier rows have not been rendered yet.
- Settings: added an option to hide starter suggestions on the new-session screen.
- Mobile/Android: terminal taps now open the keyboard, text and backspace input work with Android keyboards, and closing a focused terminal no longer leaves the app unresponsive.
- Shortcuts: fixed a regression where double-Escape could be primed when the current session was not active.
- Mobile/iOS: push notifications now use Apple’s production service by default (thanks to @natheihei).
- Mobile/iOS: notifications now work for development builds installed from Xcode — the app detects its Apple push environment and the server delivers each device to the matching endpoint, so dev (sandbox) and TestFlight/App Store (production) installs both receive pushes.
- Usage: added Crof and NeuralWatt quota tracking with subscription kWh, independent key-allowance windows, and credits-balance fallback across the web server and VS Code extension (thanks to @kydorn).

## [1.16.3] - 2026-07-22

- **Chat attachments:** added Office and OpenDocument files (`.docx`, `.pptx`, `.xlsx`, `.odt`, `.odp`, and `.ods`), with readable text and supported embedded images extracted before sending. Attachments also support more source-code formats, notebooks, HAR files with credentials and cookies removed, SVG and Draw.io files, and HEIC/HEIF images; the composer warns when the selected model may ignore an attachment type.
- **Performance:** opening and switching sessions now prioritizes the selected and visible chats in large workspaces. Failed refreshes keep the existing session list, parent sessions no longer disappear when their sub-sessions load first, and session data no longer crosses between instances, projects, or worktrees.
- **Sessions/Worktrees**: idle root sessions can now be moved with their sub-sessions and uncommitted changes into a new worktree. Worktree creation also recovers when an earlier Git operation left the repository locked.
- Desktop: the app can now start directly with a saved remote instance, URL, or pairing link without requiring a local OpenCode installation or local server.
- Scheduled Tasks: tasks can now start with permission auto-accept enabled, and the permission and Run as goal controls use the same compact toggles as the chat composer.
- Chat: assistant turns now show model, agent, thinking level, duration, and time together in the footer, and replies separated by hidden system or subagent prompts display as one continuous turn. The working indicator shows the model actually producing the active response, streaming at the bottom no longer jitters, and new user messages finish their entry animation instead of snapping into place.
- Chat/Tools: attachments returned by plugin and custom tools remain visible after streaming and refreshes, with the same image previews and file chips as chat attachments (thanks to @FrostiDrinks).
- Sidebar: projects now default to manual ordering instead of recent-activity order; explicit sorting choices remain unchanged.
- Desktop/macOS: added a setting to hide the menu bar item.
- Desktop/Windows: SSH remote instances now connect through native Windows OpenSSH without relying on unsupported connection sharing. Password authentication and port forwarding work through hidden background processes, and connection failures now show the underlying SSH error instead of a generic message.
- Mobile/Terminal: opening the terminal in a mobile browser or PWA now focuses its input and opens the keyboard without an extra tap (thanks to @bashrusakh).
- Context Panel: delayed file-open requests no longer switch the panel back to a file after you select another tab.

## [1.16.2] - 2026-07-18

- **Terminal:** rebuilt terminal sessions across the Web, Desktop, and Mobile apps with faster rendering, retained scrollback after reconnecting, shell and login-shell selection, restart and selected-output attachment actions, live theme changes, and more accurate Unicode and full-screen app rendering. Mobile now includes a full-screen terminal workspace with touch scrolling and selection, quick keys, and Ctrl/Alt input.
- **Pinned messages:** pin important user or assistant messages to restore their text to the agent after conversation compaction.
- **Settings:** pages now use a consistent responsive layout, navigation is grouped into OpenChamber, Workspace, OpenCode, and Library sections, and save failures are shown in the page header. Agent tool permissions now distinguish inherited and explicit rules and show session-granted rules separately (thanks to @makeittech).
- Session goals: audits now wait while direct subagents are still active, and goal details show the model used for the latest successful evaluation.
- Chat: if creating a session fails, the new-session draft stays open and restores the submitted prompt instead of discarding it.
- Sessions: new drafts and sessions now stay with the project selected in the sidebar, including workspaces with nested or sibling projects (thanks to @bashrusakh).
- Small Model: provider API keys referenced through environment variables or files now work for summaries, goal audits, and other Small Model features; Gemini 3 Flash models now use their supported thinking setting.
- Mobile/Android: update downloads now select an APK when a release also includes an Android App Bundle.

## [1.16.1] - 2026-07-14

- **Performance:** large session sidebars stay responsive while chats stream, including setups with many projects, worktrees, and sessions. Opening a long chat after an empty or aborted agent turn also no longer repeatedly loads larger portions of its history.
- Chat: an optional Prompt Navigator adds a marker rail beside desktop chats; hover to preview prompts, click to jump between them, or assign a shortcut in Keyboard Shortcuts settings (thanks to @makeittech).
- Chat: shell-mode command cards now update their status and output while the command runs, with syntax highlighting for the command and output.
- Chat/Subagents: task cards now track the correct subagent when several run at once, preventing one subagent's activity or "Open subtask" action from pointing to another session.
- Chat/Subagents: "Open subtask" now works for nested subagents inside the side-panel chat, with a Parent action to return to the previous subagent (thanks to @ameshkov).
- Sessions: temporary project lookup failures no longer remove worktree groups from the sidebar.
- Small Model: custom OpenAI-compatible providers now use the base URL and API key from OpenCode configuration (thanks to @ameshkov).

## [1.16.0] - 2026-07-13

- **Session goals:** arm the new target button in the composer and your next prompt becomes a [goal](https://docs.openchamber.dev/session-goals/) — the session keeps working toward it on its own, with an independent small-model audit checking each finished turn, until the objective is verifiably complete, blocked, or over its optional token budget. The loop runs on the server, so it continues with the app closed and survives restarts. A goal strip above the composer shows progress with pause/resume; goals can also start from the plan-implement dialog, from scheduled tasks ("Run as goal"), or with the new "Craft a Goal" starter and `/craft-goal` command. While a goal runs, per-turn "ready" notifications are replaced by a single notification when it settles.
- **Usage:** OpenCode Go usage tracking is here, and Codex quota windows now show the correct reset times.
- **Remote access:** connecting over the relay got much faster — the app no longer waits for a stale local address to time out before trying the relay (previously up to ~20 seconds on a phone away from home). When your computer gets a new local IP, paired devices now learn the new address over the relay and quietly move back to the local network on their own — no re-pairing. The phone's launch screen shows which device it is connecting to.
- Remote access: running several OpenChamber instances on the same machine no longer makes paired devices land on a random one of them — only one process per machine serves the relay now. This was behind intermittent "Unable to reach server" errors on paired phones.
- Permissions: per-session auto-accept now lives on the server — sessions keep auto-accepting tool calls while the app is closed and after a server restart, subagent sessions inherit the setting, and it can be enabled on a draft before the first message (thanks to @bashrusakh for the draft fix).
- Chat: subagent sessions can now be prompted directly — open a subagent from the context panel and send it follow-up messages (off by default, available in settings).
- Chat: queued messages now send when the session is already idle instead of waiting forever in some cases, pending agent questions stay answerable after a server restart, and session renames no longer flicker back to the old title (thanks to @bashrusakh).
- Files: the file viewer has a markdown preview toggle (thanks to @greghaynes).
- Sidebar: projects can be sorted by different modes with a direction toggle, pinned sessions survive refreshes, and the file tree stays expanded while it refreshes (thanks to @bashrusakh).
- Command palette: projects are included in the fuzzy search alongside sessions and files (thanks to @bashrusakh).
- Settings: chat visual settings are grouped into labeled sections, and a new editor font size setting for the code editor (thanks to @bashrusakh).
- GitHub: PR and issue context now resolves against the source repository in fork workflows (thanks to @bashrusakh).
- Agents: saving agent settings from the UI no longer drops custom YAML frontmatter fields (thanks to @bashrusakh).
- Notifications: session errors and subagent completions now notify reliably across desktop, web, and mobile.
- Editor: "Open in" now recognizes VS Code Insiders.
- Windows: paths no longer mismatch on drive letter casing, which could split one project into duplicates (thanks to @bashrusakh).
- Mobile: the sessions sidebar opens instantly instead of taking many seconds on some devices (thanks to @tomzx).
- Mobile: renaming a saved instance no longer breaks its connection — the stored access token was getting lost on edit.
- Mobile: on Android 15 the app no longer draws under the status bar.
- Security: requests that spoof local host headers to look like same-machine traffic are rejected.

## [1.15.0] - 2026-07-10

- **Remote access:** a new [private relay](https://docs.openchamber.dev/private-relay/) lets you reach your instance from anywhere — no open ports and no third-party tunnel, over an end-to-end-encrypted tunnel. It turns on by itself when you pair a device over it and turns off once no paired device uses it (thanks to @yulia-ivashko).
- **Mobile:** the native iOS and Android apps open for testing — join the [iOS public beta on TestFlight](https://testflight.apple.com/join/5ek6GU1E) or grab the Android APK from the [latest release](https://github.com/openchamber/openchamber/releases/latest). Connect by scanning a QR code from "Add a device" on your server; the app then moves between your local network and the private relay on its own — leaving home carries the open session onto the relay and coming back returns it to Wi-Fi, no re-pairing. Saved instances show a live Connected status with the active transport, iPad gets a split layout with a persistent sessions sidebar and a resizable Changes/Files sidebar, and the app checks for OpenChamber updates itself (Android shows a download toast).
- **Pairing:** a redesigned ["Add a device"](https://docs.openchamber.dev/connect-devices/) dialog asks where you'll use the device — Anywhere (relay with local network preferred at home), Home network only, or This computer only — then shows a large scannable QR code with a copyable link, and closes itself once the device connects. Links are single-use expiring codes redeemed on connect instead of embedding a long-lived token in the QR (thanks to @yulia-ivashko).
- Devices: the "Connect to this server" list now shows each paired device with a live status — Connected · Local network or Relay — and a platform badge (iOS, Android, macOS, Windows, Linux). Re-pairing or re-entering the password on the same device updates its existing entry instead of adding a duplicate.
- Devices: a paired phone or desktop names the connection after the server's hostname; the name typed when creating the link labels the device in the server's list.
- Desktop: saved servers keep every transport their pairing link carried — the app connects directly on your network and falls back to the relay away from it, including when opening a server in a new window and when restoring the connection after a restart.
- Desktop: the header dropdown (instance / usage / MCP) was restyled with cards — usage grouped per provider, hosts showing a colored status line with ping and the active host highlighted, and MCP servers in one card. Host statuses persist between openings instead of flashing "Unknown", and switching to an already-checked host is immediate.
- Desktop: the servers list in Settings shows live per-server reachability, and importing a pairing link is the primary way to add a server.
- Desktop: Windows builds can launch at login and minimize to the system tray (thanks to @achcyano).
- Chat/Tools: every tool call now expands to show its input, result, and errors, including MCP, plugin, and custom tools; Read and Skill stay compact links to their files. JSON results open in a new navigable summary view with linked URLs and expandable nested data, alongside tree and raw JSON views.
- Chat/Tools: expanded file-edit and patch results now include per-file buttons to open the diff or jump to the first changed line in the file editor.
- Chat/Thinking: reasoning parts stay separate and in chronological order instead of merging into one block, and collapsed previews no longer show empty trailing HTML comments.
- Projects: each project can now set its own default model (thanks to @makeittech).
- Diff/Chat: added a Last turn mode to the Diff view, and latest-turn changed-file chips in chat now open that snapshot while older turn chips stay read-only.
- Chat: Mermaid diagrams now have zoom controls (thanks to @c-w-xiaohei).
- Chat: code blocks can show line numbers that stay aligned while streaming, and a new Wrap Code Block Lines setting (Settings → Chat) controls long-line wrapping.
- Chat: with Sticky User Header enabled, user messages no longer float over earlier messages in long conversations.
- Chat: if sending a message times out or loses the connection after OpenCode accepted it, the app now keeps the sent message instead of rolling it back as failed.
- Mobile: selecting local files from the composer now attaches the picked files even if the composer switches between compact and expanded layouts while the file picker is open.
- Browser: links clicked inside an embedded browser tab now keep the tab on the navigated page instead of remounting the frame.
- Context Panel: raw message rows now keep token and time columns aligned without showing shortened message IDs.
- UI: closing the right sidebar after resizing no longer leaves stale width constraints behind.
- Server: remote clients with non-ASCII project paths connect again (thanks to @FanFan4204).

## [1.14.1] - 2026-07-07

- Chat: finished agent replies can now show a short recap and a suggested next message, with separate settings for each and a Small Model setting for choosing the utility model used for those helpers.
- Notes/Todos: adding selected chat text to notes now uses the Small Model to summarize it automatically.
- Voice: read-aloud can now use the Small Model to summarize long text before speaking it.
- Git/GitHub: commit message and pull-request generation now use the Small Model from setting instead of sending message to chat.
- Chat: the timeline dialog can now load older messages when the current session history has not all been fetched yet.
- Chat: file references with line ranges like `src/file.ts:10-20` are now clickable in messages (thanks to @Catan).
- Git/Diff: opening a changed file now jumps to the first changed line instead of the start of the diff hunk.
- Mobile: the composer stays focused more reliably when the keyboard opens, and the dictation transcript grows the composer like typed text.
- Mobile: iOS PWA safe areas, keyboard overlays, and app-resume connection checks were tightened up.
- Desktop: password-protected instances opened from desktop or a browser no longer take the mobile-only unlock path.

## [1.14.0] - 2026-07-05

- Voice: voice input was rebuilt around live streaming transcription — the composer mic shows a live transcript with a volume meter and timer while you speak, and a recording can be cancelled, inserted, or inserted and sent; failed transcriptions keep their audio so you can retry or accept the partial text.
- Voice: local speech-to-text works out of the box — models (Parakeet for English and 25 European languages, Whisper for a lighter multilingual option) download on demand from a new picker in Settings → Voice, or any OpenAI-compatible Whisper endpoint can be used instead; a configurable shortcut (mod+alt+v by default) toggles dictation.
- Voice: read-aloud can now use a local Kokoro voice (11 English voices), and long replies start speaking after roughly a sentence instead of waiting for the whole message.
- Voice: the Voice settings page was simplified — a single read-aloud toggle owns the playback options, and a new "Enable voice input" toggle hides the composer mic entirely.
- Mobile: the composer collapses into a compact input bar while the keyboard is closed, with a round new-session button beside it (hidden on the new-session screen); tapping the bar expands it and opens the keyboard, and the mic starts voice input straight from the compact bar.
- Mobile: the model and agent selectors moved into a row above the message text, the attachment menu and the new-session project/branch pickers open as bottom sheets with search, and a drag handle above the composer swipes it into a fullscreen editor — swiping down shrinks it back or dismisses the keyboard.
- Mobile: long conversations now load older history with a button at the top of the chat, which disappears once everything is loaded; loading older messages keeps your scroll position steady on all platforms.
- Mobile: the branch/worktree picker on the new-session screen lists all worktrees right after a cold start, and the GitHub connection status is recognized without re-running the connect flow.
- Mobile: opening the web app in a phone browser against a password-protected instance shows the password unlock page again (regressed in 1.13.9).
- Mobile: returning to the app no longer briefly flickers the session list.
- Mobile: continued polish ahead of the native app release — the chat and composer ride the keyboard in one smooth motion (including in long conversations), bottom sheets enter cleanly while the keyboard dismisses, the text cursor stays in place when the keyboard opens, starter suggestions on the new-session screen step aside while the keyboard is up, and switching instances no longer leaves the previous instance's sessions in the sessions list.
- UI: lists across the app were moved to one virtualization engine, so long lists scroll more consistently.
- Mobile: the slash-command, file/agent, skill, and snippet autocompletes were tuned for touch — they can grow up to the top of the chat area, the keyboard-hint footer and description lines are gone, row icons line up, list scrolling no longer bounces the page behind, and picking a command keeps the keyboard open.
- Mobile: in phone browsers the composer now keeps itself above the keyboard on the new-session screen and in the fullscreen editor, and opening the app shows the logo while it connects instead of flashing an unreachable-server error.
- Chat: the stop button now aborts sessions running in a different project or worktree than the currently open one — previously those aborts silently did nothing.
- Desktop: a local instance with a UI password and LAN access no longer gets stuck on "Auth required" and an unreachable-server screen (the app's client tokens are now reliably recognized as local, including for 0.0.0.0-bound servers).
- Desktop: the app prefers your own OpenCode install again — the bundled CLI is used only when no OpenCode is installed anywhere on the machine.
- Windows: OpenCode installed via npm now launches from paths with spaces (such as C:\Program Files\nodejs), binary paths pasted with surrounding quotes work, and discovery also checks the system-wide npm prefix and Scoop's shims — in the web/desktop app and the VS Code extension.

## [1.13.9] - 2026-07-02

- Mobile: added the native iOS and Android app projects ahead of the mobile app release, with continued polish for saved connections, password unlock, QR-code connection scanning, push notifications, iOS widgets, app resume, and native layout details.
- Desktop: the app can now use a bundled OpenCode CLI, or you can choose your own CLI path in settings.
- Desktop: added a Keep awake setting for the upcoming desktop app release to prevent the computer from sleeping while the app is running.
- Desktop: you can now specify optional custom headers when adding a remote OpenChamber instance to the desktop app, including for Cloudflare Access-style setups; settings and environment variables can still override them, and the bundled CLI can be replaced by setting a direct OpenCode CLI path.
- Desktop: SSH remote instances with a saved UI password now open directly after the tunnel connects instead of showing the unlock screen again.
- Chat: fixed edge cases where late-loading tool content, subagent content, or streaming Thinking blocks could pull the conversation away from the latest message or fight manual scrolling.
- Chat: embedded JSON examples in messages no longer render as generated-result cards.
- Sync: chat state now recovers after idle reconnects instead of leaving sessions stuck in a stale busy state.

## [1.13.8] - 2026-06-29

- Startup: launching the app no longer hangs for around 20 seconds before you can open a session, load a diff, or send a message — GitHub pull request status checks no longer tie up the connection to the server during startup.
- OpenCode: when a separate OpenCode is already running (the TUI, `opencode serve`, or a daemon on the default port 4096), the app now starts its own server instead of attaching to it. This fixes the "OpenChamber could not finish initialization" error and stops the app from opening or closing your separate OpenCode when it starts and quits. Connecting to an external OpenCode now requires setting `OPENCODE_HOST`, `OPENCODE_PORT`, or `OPENCODE_SKIP_START`.
- Chat: a new Follow-up behavior setting (Settings → Chat) controls what happens when you press Enter on a message while the agent is still responding — Steer inserts it into the agent's current turn, or Queue holds it until the turn finishes. Replaces the previous queue-mode toggle (thanks to @bashrusakh).
- Sessions: deleting a worktree group from the sidebar, or permanently deleting an archived session that has subagent sessions, now removes those subagent sessions too instead of leaving them behind (thanks to @bashrusakh).
- Sessions: clicking a session inside a worktree group no longer briefly jumps the selection to the project's first session while the sidebar data catches up (thanks to @bashrusakh).
- Sync: a connected but quiet session (for example an agent running a long tool call) no longer triggers repeated background refreshes every ~15 seconds (thanks to @tomzx).

## [1.13.7] - 2026-06-28

- Chat: with tool calls (such as Bash and Edit) shown expanded by default, scrolling no longer twitches, and slow scrolling no longer jumps past several messages.
- Mobile: in long conversations, older messages now load before you reach the very top, and fast scrolling no longer leaves blank gaps where messages briefly disappear until you scroll back.
- Mobile: the model and agent buttons in the composer are now borderless and cleaner, show the provider logo next to the model name, and shorten long names with an ellipsis; in the model picker the thinking-variant control is plain text with a chevron and each row's controls line up.
- Mobile: interface labels (the model and agent selectors and other small labels) are back to their previous size after 1.13.6 shrank them too much.
- Providers: the Add provider form stays open while provider data refreshes or a model is picked in the background, instead of snapping back to an existing provider.
- CLI: `openchamber update` works again after a missing helper broke the command.

## [1.13.6] - 2026-06-28

- Chat: scrolling in conversations now stays steady while sending, queueing, streaming, switching sessions, and loading older messages.
- Chat: selecting a user-installed skill from the slash command menu now invokes the skill and injects its content, instead of inserting the skill name as plain text.
- Context Panel: chat tabs now use the session title and mark the open chat as seen while you are viewing it.
- Desktop/macOS: the Dock icon can now show a badge count for chats with unseen activity, with a new Appearance setting to turn it off.
- Context Panel: Browser and Preview tabs no longer accumulate duplicate auth tokens in their URLs after reloads or navigation.

## [1.13.5] - 2026-06-27

- CLI: global web installs no longer crash on startup when tunnel commands load ngrok capabilities.
- CLI: `openchamber update` works again, and tunnel start paths no longer fail when using managed-local config prompts, multi-instance port selection, or auto-started servers.
- GitHub/Usage: fork upstream detection and Google quota checks no longer fail because of missing server helpers.

## [1.13.4] - 2026-06-27

- UI/Localization: added Japanese interface translations and Japanese documentation (thanks to @yuchi0531).
- Chat: queued messages can now be reordered by dragging them in the queue (thanks to @makeittech).
- Chat: sending a message now closes an open question prompt instead of leaving stale question UI in the composer (thanks to @tomzx).
- Chat: conversations pinned to the bottom no longer jiggle or double-scroll after sending, and revisiting older sessions snaps to the latest message without a smooth-scroll delay.
- Reviews: the Review changes dialog can now run an automatic review loop, with a chat banner for opening or stopping the linked review sessions.
- Models: the model picker now remembers provider group expansion and custom ordering, and Shift+Delete removes a recent model from recents (thanks to @makeittech).
- Shortcuts: the model-selector shortcut can now be customized (thanks to @makeittech).
- Agents: agent edits against an external OpenCode server no longer show a saved-state update when the save did not succeed (thanks to @makeittech).
- Providers: the add-provider form no longer loses the selected provider during background provider refreshes (thanks to @IbrahimKhan12).
- Worktrees: messages sent to new worktree sessions now wait until the worktree session is ready instead of racing ahead (thanks to @bashrusakh).
- Git: commit and pull-request generation from a draft session now starts from the created chat session instead of a temporary draft (thanks to @bashrusakh).
- CLI: startup and status commands now check the live server port before treating an existing process as the active OpenChamber server.

## [1.13.3] - 2026-06-24

- Chat: selecting a user-installed skill from the slash command menu now invokes the skill instead of inserting the skill name as plain text (thanks to @IbrahimKhan12).
- Chat: pasted text containing `@` no longer opens file mention autocomplete unexpectedly (thanks to @charpeni).
- Chat: code blocks in user messages now preserve characters like `<` and `->` instead of escaping them inside the code block (thanks to @bashrusakh).
- Chat: switching sessions and loading older messages no longer causes the conversation to jump backward or oscillate around the current scroll position (thanks to @herjarsa).
- Chat: Arrow Up opens prompt history again when the cursor is at the start of the composer.

- Sessions: pinned sessions and folder rows no longer disappear from the sidebar after an empty session-list refresh (thanks to @bashrusakh).
- Agents: agent settings now include thinking variant, temperature, and top-p controls, and clearing temperature or top-p now removes the override (thanks to @bashrusakh).
- Settings/Models: per-model visibility and sibling model selections now stay saved after changes (thanks to @attilaszasz).
- Settings/Skills: the skills catalog refreshes after catalog settings change (thanks to @gokulkgm).
- Providers: disconnecting a provider from settings now works for the selected provider (thanks to @bashrusakh).
- Git: Git identities can now enable SSH commit signing.
- Git: pushing from the Git view now syncs first, reducing rejected pushes when the branch needs to update.
- Usage: MiniMax M3 and Token Plan usage now handle the provider's latest API response format (thanks to @baruchvitorino).
- Startup: managed OpenCode server processes left behind by a previous crash are cleaned up on the next start.
- CLI: stale server PID files are checked more carefully so unrelated processes are not mistaken for an OpenChamber server.
- Files: downloads and file names with non-Latin characters now handle those characters correctly in headers (thanks to @FanFan4204).
- Mobile: subagent chevrons no longer overlap long session titles, and session grouping now matches the exact workspace directory (thanks to @weixiang1862, @lilyzhaun).

## [1.13.2] - 2026-06-18

- Chat/Performance: long conversations and large session lists now stay smooth and responsive while a response is streaming (thanks to @bashrusakh).
- Chat: the end of a streamed response is no longer occasionally cut off — messages now always settle on their complete text (thanks to @IbrahimKhan12).

- Files: HTML, image, and PDF previews no longer cycle to "authentication required" every ~50 seconds (thanks to @bashrusakh).
- Startup: the app starts faster by no longer waiting on default OpenCode config, while your manual and per-directory model selections are preserved.

## [1.13.1] - 2026-06-17

- Chat: inline math delimiters no longer incorrectly treat currency amounts like `$50` as LaTeX math expressions — only `$$...$$` display math and `\(...\)` inline math are recognized.
- Chat: pinned welcome starters now appear immediately when a new draft session opens, without needing to open the add dialog.
- Chat: clicking a Mermaid diagram in a chat message now opens a fullscreen pan/zoom preview.

- Startup: the model and agent now appear faster on the initial draft — config loads under the project key up front (no reload when the draft opens) and the agent list is fetched once instead of per consumer.

## [1.12.4] - 2026-06-11
