# Contributing to PiChamber

PiChamber is open to contributions. It is a Pi-native workspace with web,
desktop, hosted-mobile, and Capacitor mobile clients. The Pi SDK owns sessions,
providers, prompts, skills, extensions, and the session daemon. PiChamber owns
the workspace UI, server lifecycle, authentication, device connections, relay,
and native shells.

Please open an issue or discussion before starting a large feature. Small fixes,
documentation improvements, tests, and platform reports are welcome without a
proposal.

## Prerequisites

- Bun >=1.4.0 (1.4.2 recommended, as declared by the root `package.json` `packageManager`)
- Node.js >=22.19.0 (24 LTS recommended; `.nvmrc` pins 24)
- Git
- A supported operating system for the package you are changing

Server needs Node.js 22.19 or newer or Bun 1.4 or newer. Background `serve` and dev servers pick Node first with Bun fallback. Foreground `serve` runs in the current runtime with no PATH lookup. Startup services reuse the pinned runtime from `startup enable`. Docker images launch from pinned Bun 1.4.2. The desktop app runs its bundled Node in-process. The mobile app connects to an existing server. Runtime smoke runs with `bun run test:runtime`. It defaults to the current runtime and accepts an absolute override in `PICHAMBER_TEST_RUNTIME`. PR checks and release call the reusable runtime-smoke workflow on Linux across Node 22.19, Node 24, Bun 1.4.0, and Bun 1.4.2. See `packages/web/bin/lib/DOCUMENTATION.md` for version rules and probing.

Published server images live at `ghcr.io/ryderasking/pichamber`. The package
must remain public in GHCR so users can pull it without registry credentials.
Contributors can build from this checkout with
`docker compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.build.yml up --build`.
The image is the web server only; desktop and mobile stay out of it.

You do not need to install a separate Pi CLI for development. The web package
uses the pinned Pi SDK dependency and the desktop app starts the web server in
its own Electron process.

Desktop packaging has extra platform requirements. Read
[`packages/electron/README.md`](./packages/electron/README.md) before packaging.
Mobile development needs Xcode, CocoaPods, JDK 21, and Android SDK 35. Read
[`packages/mobile/README.md`](./packages/mobile/README.md) before building a
native app.

## Get the repository ready

```bash
git clone https://github.com/RyderAsKing/PiChamber.git
cd PiChamber
bun install
```

Run commands from the repository root unless a section says otherwise.

## Development commands

### Web

| Command | Use | Default endpoint |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `bun run dev` | Vite HMR UI plus the API server | UI `5180`, API `3902` |
| `bun run dev:web:full` | Build watcher plus the static Express server | `3001` |
| `bun run dev:web:hmr` | The same HMR flow as `dev` | UI `5180`, API `3902` |
| `bun run start:web` | Start the packaged web server | `3000` |
| `bun run stop` | Stop a local PiChamber server managed by the CLI | Depends on the instance |

Open the UI URL printed by `bun run dev`. The API endpoint is not the HMR
page. Set `PICHAMBER_HMR_UI_PORT`, `PICHAMBER_HMR_API_PORT`, or
`PICHAMBER_HMR_HOST` when the defaults do not fit your setup.

Lower-level watchers are also available as `bun run dev:web` for the web build
and `bun run dev:web:server` for the server. Most contributors should use
`bun run dev`.

### Desktop

```bash
bun run electron:dev
bun run electron:dev:bundled
bun run electron:build
```

`electron:dev` uses the HMR UI. `electron:dev:bundled` uses built web assets.
`electron:build` packages the current operating system and writes artifacts to
`packages/electron/dist`.

Desktop targets are macOS, Windows, and Linux. macOS produces DMG and ZIP
artifacts, Windows produces an NSIS installer, and Linux produces AppImage,
`.deb`, and `.rpm` artifacts for the native x64 or arm64 host. Unsigned local
installers are expected when signing credentials are not configured.

### Shared UI

`packages/ui` is a source-level library used by the web and desktop runtimes.
It has no standalone server.

```bash
bun run build:ui
bun run type-check:ui
bun run lint:ui
bun run test:ui
```

### Mobile

The Capacitor app connects to an existing PiChamber server. It does not start a
local Pi daemon on the phone or tablet.

```bash
bun run mobile:build
bun run mobile:sync
bun run mobile:build:android:debug
bun run mobile:build:ios:simulator
bun run mobile:sim:run
```

Use the simulator helpers in the `serve-sim` skill for headless iOS work. The
mobile package README contains Android device commands and platform setup.

### Documentation

The source of truth for public docs is
`packages/docs/content/docs/`. Validate it with:

```bash
bun run docs:validate
```

The separate `RyderAsKing/PiChamber-web` repository contains a hand-maintained
documentation overview. It does not currently render this MDX collection.

## Validation

Use the narrowest checks that cover your change. The common workspace checks
are:

```bash
bun run type-check
bun run lint
bun run test
bun run build
```

`bun run test` runs repository rules, tools, web, UI and Electron suites through the host runner `scripts/lab/test-env.mjs`. It removes inherited `PICHAMBER_*` runtime selectors except `PICHAMBER_TEST_*`, plus `PICHAMBER`, `PI_PACKAGE_DIR` and `ELECTRON_RUN_AS_NODE`, and uses the invoking Bun for nested commands. Mobile has package
scoped type-check and lint scripts, while native builds are validated through
the mobile workflows or platform tools.

Useful focused commands include:

```bash
bun run --cwd packages/web test -- bin/cli.test.js
bun run --cwd packages/electron test:architecture
bun run --cwd packages/electron test:updater
bun run docs:validate
bun run dead-code
```

`dead-code` is non-blocking. Read its report when you add, delete, rename, or
change exports. `bun run doctor` checks the React source tree for common issues.

Before a release, `bun run release:prepare` runs runtime smoke first, then the build, type-check, and lint
steps. `bun run release:test` exercises the native macOS Electron packaging
path. Windows and Linux packaging run on their native GitHub Actions runners;
use the desktop smoke workflow for those targets.

## Code and documentation conventions

- Keep Pi behavior behind the Pi client and `/api/pi/*` contracts. Do not
  recreate Pi session or provider logic in shared UI code.
- Keep runtime-specific behavior explicit for web, desktop, hosted mobile, and
  Capacitor mobile.
- Keep Electron entrypoints and preload bridges thin. Enforce privileged
  operations in the main process.
- Use strict TypeScript and avoid `any` without a concrete reason.
- Reuse the existing semantic theme tokens, shared buttons, and sprite icons.
- Keep components compatible with light and dark themes.
- Prefer early returns and focused modules over deep nesting.
- Do not add dependencies unless the change needs one and the dependency is
  discussed in the pull request.
- Update the nearest `DOCUMENTATION.md`, package README, or public docs when a
  contract or ownership rule changes.
- Do not add secrets, bearer tokens, pairing credentials, or user session data
  to source, tests, screenshots, logs, or issues.

Before editing, read [`AGENTS.md`](./AGENTS.md), the nearest package README and
module documentation, and every matching skill under `.agents/skills/`.

## Pull requests

Changes follow [the workflow](docs/workflow.md): an issue, a draft pull request
whose description is the plan, approval of the plan, then implementation with
proof, review and a squash merge. A pull request should be easy to review
without reconstructing the intent from the diff.

Before opening one:

1. Keep the change focused. Separate unrelated cleanup.
2. Read the repository guidance that applies to the changed packages and
   runtimes.
3. Open it as a draft and complete
   [the pull request template](.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md). The
   `pull-request` check requires every section, an issue reference and the
   acceptance criteria as a checklist.
4. Before leaving draft, run the focused validation plus any broader check
   required by the affected contract, check off every acceptance criterion and
   bring the description up to date with current evidence.

The description covers the issue, the goal, the acceptance criteria with their
proof, the approach, the affected surfaces (packages, runtimes, persisted data,
routes, CLI output or other external contracts), the repository guidance
applied, the verification (exact commands, results and anything not verified),
new decision records, findings for `CONTEXT.md`, what is out of scope, and
risks and failure behavior (compatibility, security, cleanup, rollback,
performance and partial failure where relevant).

User-visible changes need current visual evidence. Use screenshots for static
states and a short recording for motion, focus, gestures, drag-and-drop, or
multi-step interactions. Include narrow and wide layouts, light and dark themes,
and loading or error states when they are part of the change. For docs-only or
non-rendered changes, explain why visual evidence is not applicable.

## Release process

The desktop release workflow builds macOS, Windows, and Linux artifacts. macOS
artifacts are unsigned development previews with `-unsigned` filenames and are
excluded from automatic-update manifests. A tag also builds the Android release
artifact. Publishing `@pi-chamber/web` is explicit through the Release workflow.
PiChamber does not currently publish an iOS release because Apple distribution
signing is not configured.

To start version `X.Y.Z`:

1. Cut a temporary branch `release/X.Y.Z` from `main`. It lives until the
   stable release publishes, then delete it. `main` keeps moving meanwhile;
   expect small manual resolution when forward-porting fixes.
2. Never merge the release branch back into `main`: that would drag `-rc`
   versions and RC changelog sections along. Forward-port fixes with
   cherry-picks instead (see Stable release below).
3. Stabilize with release candidates on that branch, then finish the stable
   release on `main`.

A tag builds and uploads desktop artifacts and Android artifacts. To publish the
npm package, dispatch the workflow with `publish_npm=true`. To build Android
from a manual dispatch, enable `publish_mobile`. The root release workflow does
not upload iOS. The separate **Mobile Release** workflow can publish to TestFlight
after Apple distribution signing and App Store Connect credentials are configured.

The release workflow creates a draft, checks the changelog and package
versions, verifies updater manifests, and publishes the draft after the desktop
jobs and any enabled Android build succeed. Review the draft assets before making the release public.

### Release candidates

Use `X.Y.Z-rc.N` versions to test the next stable desktop release. The release
workflow accepts stable versions and numbered RC versions only. It rejects
other prerelease labels.

To prepare candidate `0.9.9-rc.1` on branch `release/0.9.9`:

1. On `release/0.9.9`, run `bun run version:bump 0.9.9-rc.1`. This updates
   the root, UI, web, and Electron manifests. It intentionally does not
   change `packages/mobile`.
2. Add a dated `## [0.9.9-rc.1] - YYYY-MM-DD` changelog section on the
   release branch.
3. Run `bun run release:prepare`, `bun run docs:validate`, and the focused
   release checks for the platforms being published.
4. Push `v0.9.9-rc.1` from the release branch so the tag points at the
   release-branch commit, or dispatch the **Release** workflow with
   `version=0.9.9-rc.1` while selecting `release/0.9.9` as the run branch.
   Dispatching from `main` fails the version check because `main` never
   carries `-rc` versions.

Fix stabilization issues on branches cut from the release branch and open
PRs back into it. For another candidate, repeat from the release-branch tip
with `0.9.9-rc.2`. Do not reuse or move an existing RC tag.

GitHub marks the result as a prerelease. Electron users subscribe under
Settings → About. The default Stable option reads only the `latest` updater
channel. Release candidate compares `latest` and `rc` and offers the higher
version. This lets a subscriber update automatically from `0.9.9-rc.1` to
`0.9.9-rc.2`, then to the final `0.9.9`, while remaining subscribed for the
next RC cycle.

If npm publication is enabled for an RC, the workflow publishes it under the
`rc` dist-tag instead of `latest`. npm users opt in explicitly with
`npm install -g @pi-chamber/web@rc` and return to stable with
`npm install -g @pi-chamber/web@latest`; the Electron setting does not affect
npm installations. Android artifacts are attached to the GitHub
prerelease; iOS TestFlight remains a separate manual workflow.

### Stable release

1. Forward-port the fix commits from `release/X.Y.Z` to `main` with
   cherry-picks (not a merge). Resolve drift manually.
2. On `main`, run `bun run version:bump X.Y.Z` and write the consolidated
   `## [X.Y.Z] - YYYY-MM-DD` changelog section covering the release plus
   stabilization fixes. Move applicable notes from `CHANGELOG.md` under
   `[Unreleased]` into that dated heading, exactly named. RC sections stay
   on the release branch; `main` gets one final section.
3. Run `bun run release:prepare`, `bun run docs:validate`, and the focused
   release checks for the platforms being published.
4. Merge the stable release commit to `main`.
5. Push `vX.Y.Z` from `main`, or dispatch the **Release** workflow with
   `version=X.Y.Z` from `main`. Delete the temporary `release/X.Y.Z`
   branch after the stable release publishes.

Release credentials are configured only in GitHub Actions secrets. Depending on
the artifacts being published, the workflows use `NPM_TOKEN`, Android signing
secrets, iOS provisioning and App Store Connect secrets, and
`PICHAMBER_WEBSITE_REPO_TOKEN`. Signed macOS distribution will also require
Apple signing and notarization secrets when it is enabled. The website token must be
able to send repository dispatches to the private `RyderAsKing/PiChamber-web`
repository. Never put secret values in a commit or issue.
