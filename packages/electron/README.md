# PiChamber Desktop

Electron is PiChamber's native desktop shell for macOS, Windows, and Linux.

## Runtime

`main.mjs` starts `@pi-chamber/web/server/index.js` in the Electron main process. It runs on the bundled Electron Node, which meets the 22.19 minimum. It never probes PATH or switches runtimes. It never starts a server sidecar or manages an external coding-agent binary. Development loads the HMR UI; packaged builds load staged assets from `pichamber-ui://` while the in-process loopback server remains the authenticated API backend. Unpackaged `electron ./main.mjs` reports host Electron version `0.0`; main pins `package.json` (or `0.0.0-dev`) onto `app.setVersion` before constructing `electron-updater`.

The preload bridge exposes only desktop-owned capabilities. Main-process handlers enforce every privileged action; remote pages do not receive local filesystem, shell, token, or host privileges. Native application-menu commands that change renderer state are delivered through preload events and handled by the full UI app; Electron roles such as minimize and quit remain main-process actions. Shell settings such as launch at login, tray behavior, keep awake, and process performance recording remain available when the local Electron window uses a remote PiChamber runtime. Electron persists install identity, host connections, local credentials, port, window state, and Windows/Linux minimize and close behavior in the PiChamber data root's `runtime-state.json`. On a new install, minimizing leaves the window in the taskbar and closing hides it in the system tray. Settings in General can configure each action separately. Existing installs with an explicit value for the old combined tray setting keep that close behavior until it is changed. It reads the old flat `settings.json` only until the server completes the one-time settings split.

## Process performance recording

Settings → General → Diagnostics can enable local Electron process recording. The main process samples Electron CPU and memory metrics, its Node heap, and the web-contents count every 10 seconds. It writes newline-delimited JSON under `<userData>/performance` and resumes recording after restart until disabled. Records contain aggregate process data only; they must never include session IDs, paths, URLs, credentials, prompts, filenames, or message content.

`process-performance-recorder.mjs` owns sampling and file output. The renderer may only get or set the enabled state through desktop IPC from the local Electron window, regardless of its active PiChamber runtime.

## Development

```bash
bun run electron:dev
bun run electron:dev:bundled
bun run --cwd packages/electron type-check
bun run --cwd packages/electron test:architecture
```

## Packaging

```bash
bun run electron:build
```

For a local Linux dev build, `bun run electron:build:dev` builds only the AppImage and installs it at `packages/electron/dist/dev/PiChamber.AppImage` in the main checkout, also when it runs in a git worktree, so the executable path stays the same across builds. The file is replaced by an atomic rename after a successful build: a running instance keeps its old image, and a failed build leaves the previous one in place. It then copies the build to `~/AppImages/pichamber.appimage`, the path the desktop entry and Gear Lever start, in the same way (copy next to the target, then rename). `PICHAMBER_DEV_APPIMAGE_INSTALL_PATH` sets a different target, and setting it to an empty value skips the copy. A failed copy fails the command; the `dist/dev` file is already updated at that point. Release builds keep their versioned names under `dist/`.

Packaging builds web assets, bundles the Electron main process, rebuilds native modules, and runs electron-builder. It stages only the web UI and native desktop resources; Pi sessions are served by the in-process PiChamber server. Local dictation uses the same in-process server and loads the packaged `sherpa-onnx` addon only in its forked STT worker. PiChamber's UI is currently English-only, so electron-builder retains only Chromium's English locale pack (`en-US` on Windows/Linux and `en` on macOS) instead of shipping every Chromium translation. The staged `resources/web-dist` is the packaged UI; build filters exclude `@pi-chamber/web/dist` from `app.asar` so those same assets are not shipped twice.

Windows desktop uses the same Pi SDK as the [Pi CLI](https://pi.dev/docs/latest): sessions live under `%USERPROFILE%\.pi\agent`, private IPC is a named pipe, and the bash tool needs Git for Windows (or another `bash.exe` on PATH), matching [Pi's SDK](https://pi.dev/docs/latest/sdk).

Desktop PNG/ICO/ICNS brand assets, the Linux hicolor icon set, web favicons, and mobile launcher/splash PNGs are generated from the PiChamber SVG mark with `bun run icons:brand`. The macOS 26 `Assets.car` catalog still requires `bun run --cwd packages/electron generate:macos-icon` on a Mac with Xcode.

GitHub Releases for this package are produced by `.github/workflows/release.yml`. Desktop artifacts are built on every release. Each platform build saves validated Actions artifacts; one downstream job then revalidates, stages the complete desktop inventory, and uploads files sequentially with bounded retries. A new release remains a draft until the workflow verifies every expected installer, package, blockmap, and applicable update manifest. A repair dispatch preserves an existing release's draft or public state while replacing its assets in place. Android artifacts are built for version tags and can be enabled on a manual dispatch; npm publication is opt-in. PiChamber does not currently publish iOS releases because Apple distribution signing is not configured. See `CONTRIBUTING.md` for the version and tag steps.

Desktop users choose **Desktop app update channel** under Settings → About while the Local instance is active. The default `stable` subscription reads only the `latest` manifests. Unsigned macOS development previews are excluded from these manifests and must be updated manually. The `release candidate` subscription checks both `latest` and `rc`, then offers the higher eligible version, so it receives numbered RC builds and their final stable release. When Electron is connected to another PiChamber instance, Settings keeps **Desktop app update channel** visible and also shows **Server update channel**. About shows separate client and server versions, checks both update feeds, and opens the updater for whichever version is marked as outdated. The desktop preference is read and written through local Electron IPC, while the server preference is written to the active server. Both preferences live in their owning host's `runtime-state.json`; invalid or missing values fall back to `stable`. The release workflow publishes separate `latest*` and `rc*` manifests so stable subscribers cannot receive an RC.

`updater-check.mjs` serializes desktop checks and downloads across windows because Electron keeps one mutable download target. Each new check invalidates the prior pending record before probing; a failed check requires another successful check before download or installation, even if an older installer remains cached. Download completion must match the selected version before it becomes installable. An absent RC release or missing channel manifest permits the other eligible feed to win, but DNS and server failures remain errors rather than authoritative no-update results. Update dialogs read the relevant Markdown sections from `CHANGELOG.md` at the selected version tag, preserving the full RC range without depending on `main`. If that file is unavailable, the updater reads the selected version's Markdown body from the GitHub Releases API, then accepts electron-updater notes only when they are plain text or Markdown; rendered Atom-feed HTML is never passed to the Markdown renderer.

### Linux distribution

Linux releases include `.deb`, `.rpm`, and AppImage artifacts for x64 and arm64. The `.deb` package is the recommended choice for Debian-family distributions and `.rpm` is recommended for Fedora-family distributions. Package-manager installations retain Electron's normal Chromium sandbox and use the package-specific updater.

AppImages are portable and do not require installation, but the AppImage format cannot provide Electron's root-owned `chrome-sandbox` helper from a user-mounted filesystem. PiChamber therefore launches AppImages with Chromium's `--no-sandbox` compatibility mode; installed `.deb`/`.rpm` packages should be preferred when the full Chromium sandbox is required. AppImages should be copied to a writable Linux filesystem, such as `~/.local/opt/pichamber`, and kept at a stable filename if a desktop shortcut is created.

Linux AppImage updates are staged and validated before the existing file is replaced. The previous image is retained until the restarted packaged UI confirms a successful launch; a failed restart is recovered on the next launch. The updater preserves the current AppImage path so existing desktop shortcuts do not become stale.

Native Linux package installs run their privileged package command asynchronously. Polkit or sudo authentication does not block the Electron window.

macOS artifacts are unsigned development previews until Apple Developer Program signing and notarization are configured. Their filenames end in `-unsigned`, and the release workflow does not publish them to an updater channel. The public install guide documents the Gatekeeper warning and the manual quarantine workaround. When signed distribution is enabled, restore the normal artifact names, publish a macOS updater manifest, and require signature and notarization checks before release.

## Platform rules

- Keep native windows, menus, updater, deep-link, and IPC behavior in this package.
- Keep shared UI behavior in `packages/ui` and server behavior in `packages/web`.
- Background processes on Windows must use direct hidden spawns (`windowsHide: true`) and never `cmd.exe` wrappers.
- Validate both HMR and bundled UI startup after changing startup, preload, routing, or packaging.
