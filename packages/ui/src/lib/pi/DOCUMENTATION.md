# Pi shared UI module

## Purpose

This directory owns the Pi-native runtime boundary. It defines:

- The Pi session / message / part data shapes (`types.ts`).
- The public `/api/pi/` IPC envelope (`protocol.ts`), including the `extension.*` events that project pi extension UI (blocking dialogs and their authoritative dismissals, notifications, statuses, widgets, custom entries/messages, runtime errors) onto the public stream.
- The pi-subagents async status parser (`subagentStatusSnapshot.ts`). The `subagent-async` extension widget carries one line, `PI_SUBAGENT_ASYNC_JSON:` plus a version 1 `pi-subagents.async-status-snapshot` (bounded runs, nested children, `omitted` counts; types mirror pi-subagents `async-status-projection.ts`, nothing is imported from it). `parseSubagentStatusLine` is pure and never throws: a missing prefix, malformed or truncated JSON, an unknown `kind` or `version`, a state or node kind outside the protocol, a malformed node, or nesting past the recursion guard returns `{ ok: false }`, never a partial snapshot, and the Extensions card then shows `Subagent status unavailable` instead of raw text. The widget key `subagent-inspect` (on-demand inspect replies) is never rendered. Elapsed and last-activity times are measured against the snapshot's `generatedAt`, so rows refresh with each republished snapshot and the view runs no timer.
- The PiChamber extension GUI parser (`extension-ui.ts`). It validates `pichamber.ui` descriptors from extension custom entries/messages into render-ready components (markdown, kv, list, table, progress, badges, code) plus action buttons; unknown content degrades to a generic card instead of being dropped.
- The pi-subagents supervisor parser (`supervisor-ui.ts`). It recognizes `subagent_supervisor_request` custom messages (payload in `details`) and `subagent_supervisor_reply` custom entries (payload in `data`) with the same validation as pi-subagents' `src/intercom/supervisor-ui.js` (nothing is imported from it) and projects agent, reason (Decision, Interview, Progress), the question or reply, and the run, child, request id and reply hint rows. Text is bounded (512 characters per field, 8000 for bodies, 4000 for the interview shape) and control characters become `[U+XXXX]`. A failed validation returns `undefined`, never throws, and the caller falls back to the generic extension row.
- The browser-side transport for `/api/pi/events` (`transport.ts`), using authenticated SSE by default and one active connection per stream generation. Explicit WebSocket mode remains only for runtimes that provide a matching upgrade endpoint; fetch-based SSE comment heartbeats count as liveness. The transport owns the full connection lifecycle: every replay subscribe carries the `events.streamEpoch` capability marker plus the `streamEpoch` the cursor was established under. A pre-bootstrap recovery subscribe with no established epoch omits the cursor and accepts the daemon's snapshot baseline. The daemon rejects a marker-less cursor as `DAEMON_PROTOCOL_MISMATCH` and refuses to replay a cursor from a retired epoch even when its own sequence numerically overtook it. SSE connects run under a setup deadline that disposes a late attempt through the generation guard; URL-token minting is bounded; a pending backoff is woken once by `online`, visibility, and resume signals; the consecutive-failure count resets only after a connection stays healthy for a sustained window, so flapping links keep their exponential backoff. A known 401/403 stops the retry loop and reports `onAuthRequired`; the owning store enters the existing auth flow and preserves local work. A bounded health probe classifies status-less native EventSource errors, so a transient 503 or unreachable probe never becomes a logout. Stream-epoch transitions observed on the wire are adopted only after an authoritative health probe confirms them; a frame from a retired epoch is dropped without downgrade, and an unverifiable foreign epoch re-establishes the stream instead of being adopted. Because a restarted daemon sends no frame for a subscribed session it no longer holds, every resubscribe after the first ready connection also runs one bounded health probe: a different live epoch is retired and reported through `onEpochChange` exactly like a verified frame (cursor dropped), while an unchanged or unverifiable result changes nothing. The restarted daemon's resync snapshot usually lands while that probe runs; the first foreign-epoch frame is held rather than dropped, then delivered when the probe adopted its epoch or sent through the normal foreign-frame verification otherwise, so an unverifiable probe cannot lose the only new-lifetime frame. A resubscribe that becomes ready while another probe is still in flight (for example one for an older, now stale connection) is probed once that probe ends rather than skipped. Both the first-attach stream (`bootstrap.ts`) and reconnect streams (`reconnect.ts`) forward `onEpochChange` to the owning store, which resets old-lifetime transcripts and cursors and queues recovery. `reducers/reducerHelpers.ts` caches the ordered message list per `messages` map and reuses it only while every cached entry is still the map's current value, so a same-key replacement (hydration marking the in-flight assistant streaming) cannot project a running turn as completed.
- The runtime health memo (`transport.ts` `fetchPiRuntimeHealth`). Cold start probes `GET /api/pi/runtime` from several owners at once (config connection check, first-attach open, project-less connect). Genuinely concurrent probes already merge in `runtime-fetch` read coalescing (`runtime` is in `COALESCE_READ_PATH`); sequential boot probes additionally share a 3 s settled memo of `ready` results only, keyed by runtime identity and cleared by `resetPiRuntimeHealthCache()` through the central runtime-endpoint reset. `unavailable`/error results never memoize, so retry loops always observe the live daemon. Recovery probing bypasses with `{ fresh: true }`: the reconnect owner path, the stream-epoch verification probes, and the EventSource auth-classifier probe all pass it, because a stale `ready` would mask a restarted or unreachable daemon. Boot callers use the default memoized path. Companion boot-read memos follow the same contract elsewhere: the server home read (`lib/fsApi.ts` `getFilesystemHomeState`, shared by the directory store and the project config readers so startup issues one `GET /api/fs/home` per runtime; failures and null homes never memoize; the directory explorer's explicit fresh resolver bypasses) and the dictation status read (`lib/dictation/stt-status.ts` `fetchSttStatus`, shared by the composer hook and Dictation settings with a 30 s TTL; failures never memoize; post-action refreshes and the download-progress poll bypass).
- Stream cadence (`stream-cadence.ts`): adjacent same-part token deltas fold, then flush on `requestAnimationFrame` together with live `session.tool.update` frames; boundary events flush pending stream frames first.
- The service facade that wraps every `/api/pi/*` call (`client.ts`). Session detail responses contain a bounded tail page; `getSessionMessages` requests older pages with the response's opaque before-cursor. Native Pi commands are discovered through `/api/pi/commands?directory=...` and execute through Pi's `session.prompt()` resolver, which remains authoritative for extension execution, skill expansion, and prompt-template expansion; PiChamber never implements `$1`/`$@` expansion and never expands skill files itself. Invocation is distinct by kind: `/name` invokes a Pi prompt template or extension command per Pi resolution (extension wins on collision), `/skill:name` invokes a Pi skill (bare `/name` never invokes a skill), and `#name` expands a PiChamber snippet literally. Supported PiChamber system commands (`undo`, `redo`, `timeline`, `compact`) intercept before Pi; TUI-only names (`reload`, `model`, `settings`, `init`) are never advertised. The shared `commandCatalog.ts` owns executable identity (`invocationName`), with `/review` vs `/skill:review` as different commands, prompt/extension `/review` colliding with the extension winning, and identical `/review` rows never rendered twice. Catalogs are scoped by runtime, effective directory, and revision; runtime switches clear, directory switches never show another directory's rows, failures preserve the same scope's last known catalog, and prompt create/update/rename/delete, extension reload, and skill reload invalidate. `GET /api/pi/resources` is additionally memoized inside `client.ts`: one shared in-flight request plus a 5 s settled result per runtime + directory scope, so the sequential prompt-store and skill-store loads on startup cost one GET. Failures never populate the memo, every successful resource mutation (`updateResource`, prompt create/update/delete) clears the memo for its runtime and orphans older in-flight completions so stale data cannot overwrite fresh post-mutation results, every return is an independent `structuredClone` so callers never share mutable state, and explicit reload paths pass `scope.reload` (or call `invalidateResourcesCache`) to bypass the settled memo. `GET /api/pi/commands` is fetched once per scope no matter how many `useCommandCatalog` mounts exist: concurrent mounts share one in-flight request, and a fresh (30 s) entry whose recorded prompt/skill signatures still validate skips the fetch entirely, so a remount within the window costs zero requests. An entry recorded before the prompt/skill stores finished their first load carries empty signatures and is adopted on empty → loaded without refetching — the commands response already reflects those resources server-side, so the boot transition never causes a second fetch (the first fetch is never deferred, so commands appear as fast as before). A real signature change (loaded → different) still refetches, as does any invalidation-revision bump; a real store change that lands mid-flight chains exactly one follow-up fetch so the edit is not stuck behind the shared result; failures never write the entry, preserving last-known data without marking it fresh. Pi-owned prompt templates are mutated only through `resources.prompts.create/update/delete` with an explicit effective directory and opaque resource IDs — never delete-followed-by-create from the browser. Prompt update accepts name, description, and content, preserves unknown frontmatter (for example `argument-hint`), validates the destination name and scope, rejects collisions, writes atomically, removes the source only after the destination succeeds, rolls back the destination when source removal fails, enforces project trust, preserves existing files on failure, refreshes affected idle Pi sessions in place, defers busy-session activation until a safe lifecycle edge, and returns sanitized projections without filesystem paths. Prompt mutations never dispose session runtimes. Pi trust changes, provider model catalogs, and non-prompt resource edits commit to disk without interrupting an active turn. Their mutation responses carry `deferred: true` when resident runtime recreation waits for an idle edge, and new sessions use the saved values immediately. Pi default model and thinking settings already target new sessions. PiChamber-owned snippets use `/api/pi/snippets`, remain scoped by runtime and effective directory, support rename and global/project moves by opaque ID, and perform literal `#name` expansion without Pi prompt-template arguments. All runtimes (web, Electron, hosted-mobile, Capacitor) use the connected server's storage via `runtimeFetch`/`piClient`; caches are keyed by runtime and effective directory, cleared on runtime switch, and failed fetches preserve the prior same-directory snapshot instead of masquerading as empty success.
- The snapshot reducer helpers (`snapshot.ts`).
- The event reducer helpers (`event-reducer.ts`). `projectSession` is incremental: pass the previous session and projection so unchanged historical messages and parts keep their object identity, and a no-op live-tail remap returns the previous projection object. Ordered message lists are cached on the reducer `messages` Map; projected parts are cached on reducer part identity. `parts` is a copy-on-write map (`CowMap`): token/tool deltas `fork()` a snapshot-private overlay instead of cloning every historical part, and flatten after a bounded depth. Each applied event records `lastMutatedMessageId` / `lastMutationKind` so live-tail freeze can skip an O(session) part walk. `session.deleted` is an authoritative tombstone: it deletes the resident row while advancing the per-session cursor so stale live events cannot resurrect it and duplicates stay idempotent. Extension events append extension-role transcript items, maintain live status/widget maps and the blocking-dialog queue, and keep bounded notice/error feeds. The selected session's footer statuses render as a single horizontal, touch-scrollable strip rather than wrapping into stacked rows. Standard Pi RPC editor updates replace only the owning visible session's composer; background-session events stay resident until that session is selected. Session-scoped extension titles flow through the shared window-title owner on web, desktop, mini-chat, hosted mobile, and Capacitor. Extension catalog invalidations refresh provider/resource data without clearing the previous authoritative snapshot on failure, while command autocomplete keys its refetch to a low-frequency per-session revision. `extension.dialog.dismiss` removes answered, timed-out, aborted, or disposed requests on every client; authoritative `getSession` hydration and stream snapshots restore extension statuses, widgets, dialogs, panels, apps, and titles through the same sequence watermark instead of preserving requests the daemon omitted or skipping one-time startup state. `dismissExtensionDialog` removes a successfully answered request locally without touching sequence bookkeeping.
- The bootstrap owner (`bootstrap.ts`).
- The reconnect owner (`reconnect.ts`).
- The server timestamp helper (`server-clock.ts`), which normalizes server event/detail timestamps to the local clock for elapsed timers.
- The attachment helpers (`attachments.ts`).
- The configured-provider helper for selection catalogs (`configured-providers.ts`).
- Hidden-model selection filtering (`hidden-models.ts`).
- Session default helpers (`session-defaults.ts`) and Pi thinking-level rules (`thinking.ts`).
- Composer thinking override (`apply-composer-thinking.ts`). Picker changes stay local; `routeMessage` commits them on send.

The module uses native `Response` parsing through `runtimeFetch` so callers
can distinguish failure from a successful empty result. `MainLayout` is the
mounted owner for web, desktop, mini-chat, and mobile chrome. Session truth
lives in `PiSessionStore` via `PiSessionProvider`; chat leaves consume
`pi-to-renderable` adapters and local render contracts.

Capacitor's native HTTP fetch adapter buffers long responses, so direct native
mobile clients use URL-authenticated `EventSource` for `/api/pi/events`.
WKWebView can preserve a dead `EventSource` across suspension without firing an
error, so the native system-resume signal replaces that connection and resumes
from its last accepted sequence. Relay-backed mobile clients continue through
`runtimeFetch` and the encrypted tunnel, where browser `EventSource` cannot
address the virtual endpoint.

## Public types vs. private runtime

The browser-facing shapes are the public contract. The daemon module owns
the private IPC; the server-side proxy translates one to the other. UI code
must never import the private daemon shapes.

## Failure semantics

Every fetch helper that can mutate, replace, or clear state throws on
failure. The bootstrap and reconnect owners record failures into a list of
phase-tagged errors rather than swallowing them; the caller decides whether
to retry or surface a toast.

A failed runtime probe is `unavailable`, not an empty session list. The
sidebar must show the unavailable banner until the daemon reports `ready`
again; the bootstrap owner returns `phase: 'failed'` only when the probe
fails, and `phase: 'unavailable'` would have been a misnomer — the probe
path returns `phase: 'failed'` with an explicit `errors[]` entry so the
caller can render the correct message.

## Sequencing and reconnect

Every event the public stream publishes carries a monotonically increasing
`sequence` number from the daemon's global counter **and** an opaque
`streamEpoch` — a random stream-lifetime identifier regenerated on every
daemon process start. The daemon advertises the `events.streamEpoch`
capability and stamps health, events, snapshots, and session read responses
(list, detail) with the epoch. Bootstrap and reconnect gate on the capability
and reject marker-less list/detail responses with `DAEMON_PROTOCOL_MISMATCH` once
that capability establishes an epoch; the store likewise rejects unstamped late
responses and events because their daemon lifetime cannot be verified. This is
fail-visible because a daemon
restart resets the sequence space: a live cursor from the previous process
would silently swallow every new event. Sequence comparisons are therefore
epoch-scoped. The reducer stores the last
accepted sequence per session id and rejects any event for that session whose
sequence is `<=` the last accepted value. `getSession` reports that same global
cursor, not proof that the returned transcript contains every locally applied
delta, so hydration overlays an in-flight busy/retry turn, or a resident reducer
with a newer sequence, onto the fetched history instead of replacing it. Once
the resident turn has settled and the fetched cursor is at least as new, the
fetch is authoritative for overlapping messages and parts; otherwise snapshot
recovery can succeed while stale partial text remains visible. A message-start
event is itself live-turn evidence, so the reducer marks the session busy even
when its lifecycle frame was missed or arrives later. The daemon projects that
in-flight turn into
`getSession` while `isStreaming` is true (live `session.messages` plus running
tools, plus `lifecycle: 'busy'`). Running tool parts carry their server start
stamp through the same detail, and tool events include a `serverNow` sample so
clients normalize elapsed time before rendering it. First-attach bootstrap keeps the detail's
`runStartedAt`/`serverNow` beside the reducer result so the store can adopt the
authoritative turn origin before the working UI mounts. `hydrateSessionFromDetail` restores
`streamingMessages` and part streaming flags from that payload so a restarted
chat shows the working/tooling state immediately. When resumed events use the
daemon's synthetic live id for an assistant already hydrated under its Pi entry
id, reducer aliases remain valid lookup keys but live-tail selectors and mutation
metadata resolve to the canonical message id used by rendered records. If a resumed assistant references a synthetic user id from before this client's cursor, the latest hydrated user on the authoritative branch owns that assistant and prevents turn projection from dropping it as an orphan. Sending a prompt on an already-open session
must not install an empty `bySession` row: live events only carry the new
turn, so a blank placeholder would make prior history disappear. If the
resident transcript is missing or empty, `prompt()` re-hydrates from the
append-only session log first. The same restore runs when a live event
arrives for a session whose transcript was dropped but whose `lastSequence`
cursor remains. That restore forces `getSession` even if the live event already
created a one-turn resident row, then overlays the JSONL log onto it. Reconnect resumes from
`max(clientAppliedMax, snapshot.lastSequence)` so a quieter session cannot
rewind the runtime stream into the retained event log — unless the
health-verified epoch changed (daemon restart), in which case the old cursor
belongs to a retired sequence space and the snapshot baseline is used
verbatim (`epochChanged`); a blind max across epochs would let a new daemon
whose sequence overtook the old cursor skip the head of the new sequence
space. A snapshot published because the requested cursor could not be replayed
(replay miss, restart, or retired-epoch cursor) is stamped `resync: true` to
mark it as a recovery baseline rather than a routine attach. A session detail
stamped with a retired epoch is rejected so its sequence from another space is
never committed. It merges the selected
session snapshot into the existing cluster without disposing other hydrated
sessions, and reattaches the runtime-wide stream with the same disconnect
handler; a later `session.snapshot` (replay window missed) force-hydrates that
session from `getSession` so missed tool/text updates are not stuck until a
manual refresh. Narrowing that stream would
lose events after the next resident session switch. Pi's delta
`contentIndex` is a stable content-block identity and may repeat for every
chunk in that block; reducers apply those chunks with `applyAssistantTextDelta`
(incremental suffix, cumulative snapshot, or bounded overlapping tail) and
use event sequence for deduplication. Cadence folding uses the same merge so
a frame of cumulative chunks cannot concatenate into stuttering markdown.
`assistant.message.end` writes the canonical `text`/`thinking` onto the
rendered parts; message-level fields alone are not what the chat paints. When
that assistant produced tool calls, the end frame carries `continuing: true`.
That frame ends a text segment, not the turn, so the reducer keeps
`message.streaming:true` and the turn's live `streamingMessages` ownership
across the message-end/tool-start boundary and does not flash a settled
footer. Only a terminal `assistant.message.end` (non-continuing, non-error)
or a terminal lifecycle (`idle`/`error`/`interrupted`) settles the message.
An errored
message end also keeps that ownership until Pi publishes retry or a terminal
lifecycle. Retry metadata survives Pi's preparatory `busy` frame and the next
assistant start, then clears only when text, thinking, or tool output proves the
new attempt is streaming. Compaction is separate authoritative per-session
state, not a `busy` heuristic. `session.compaction` and reconnect/getSession
snapshots preserve manual/threshold/overflow reason, active/retrying/terminal
phase, retry timing, redacted failure, compact-and-retry intent, and available
pre/post token estimates. The chat overlays that notice on the turn whose
timestamp precedes the compaction boundary, so a completed historical notice
does not move onto a later turn. Manual `/compact` is acknowledged
asynchronously and optional command text is forwarded as Pi custom compaction
instructions.
Thinking parts also clear `streaming` as soon as a later text or tool part
on the same message starts, so the thinking block can collapse at handoff
instead of waiting for message-end.
When the producing turn carries Pi `Usage`, the same event also attaches the
sanitized `usage` to the assistant message record so the context sidebar can
read it directly. The `usage` shape is `{ input, output, cacheRead, cacheWrite, totalTokens, cost: { input, output, cacheRead, cacheWrite, total } }` —
numbers only, finite, non-negative, never NaN or unknown keys. Pi has no
separate reasoning-token field; thinking is a content block, so the
sidebar's reasoning tile stays `—` when `usage` is present. The snapshot
hydrate path and `assistant.message.start` event do not carry usage; the
authoritative source is the message-end turn completion. A snapshot is itself an event with `name: 'session.snapshot'`;
The snapshot reducer replaces the running state when the snapshot's
`lastSequence` is strictly greater than the previously accepted snapshot.
Hydration copies `session.model` / `session.thinking` from `getSession` and
prefers the latest assistant turn so reopening an older chat keeps that
session's last used model and thinking instead of the globally last-selected
composer values. Reconnect still unions an in-flight session's existing messages onto that
snapshot so a mid-send reconnect cannot blank the open transcript.

## Runtime-switch and failure handling

Service requests capture an optional runtime key and re-check it after the
response has arrived, so a remote-host switch cannot commit an old response
into the new runtime. Stream generations use the same captured identity; old-
runtime events and reconnect completions are ignored. The event stream uses
the shared authenticated URL resolver for WebSocket and SSE URLs, `runtimeFetch`
for SSE, and `openRuntimeWebSocket` for WS/relay operation. Only one connection
is active per generation; a failed WS is closed before SSE fallback or
reconnect begins.

Sends (`sendPrompt`/`sendSteer`/`sendFollowUp`) are attempted exactly once
(`retry: false` in `jsonRequest`): transient 503/network retries remain for
GETs and other calls, but an accepted send whose reply was lost across a
daemon restart must never auto-retry. Callers label each intent with a stable
`PiPromptInput.operationId`; the client captures the active runtime's latest
health-verified `streamEpoch` at the send boundary, and
`PiPromptResult.deduplicated` marks same-epoch daemon deduplication.
`PiService.getSendReceipt({ sessionId, kind, operationId, streamEpoch })`
POSTs the exact `{ kind, operationId, streamEpoch }` to
`/api/pi/sessions/:id/send-receipt` with the directory scope (`?directory=`)
and never invokes Pi. On unconfirmed transport/5xx/timeout/runtime-change/
malformed failures the client attempts that read-only lookup when
`operationId` is present and returns the original receipt only on `accepted`
(`pending`/`expired`/`unknown` or a failed lookup preserves the original
failure as `PiSendUnconfirmedError` with `cause` and never replays the send).
Definite 4xx preflight rejections (except 408, `OPERATION_EXPIRED`, and
`STALE_STREAM_EPOCH`) stay `PiRequestError`. A missing or changed epoch and a
server `STALE_STREAM_EPOCH` become `PiSendUnconfirmedError`, so queued callers
hold for explicit history/status review instead of replaying under the new
daemon lifetime. Sends and receipt lookups forward the directory scope and
guard both runtime key and epoch before and after; no prompt text is logged.

## Mounted UI ownership

`packages/ui/src/apps/pi-session-store.ts` owns the active connected runtime's
session cluster: one event stream, `reducer.bySession`, `hydratedSessionIds`,
the runtime generation guard, and a separate `directory` focus pointer for the
sidebar list and new-session cwd. Older transcript pages are prepended into the resident reducer session. Concurrent demand for one cursor shares a request; runtime changes, navigation, deletion, and eviction reject stale page completions. A failed page leaves the resident transcript and cursor intact for retry. Reconnect tail hydration preserves already loaded older pages, but a historical page never advances the live event sequence because it does not cover intervening events.

The cluster lives until a runtime switch,
`clear()`, or `dispose()`; switching the focused project is a pointer change
that never disposes the stream, drops hydrated sessions, or rewrites
`hydratedSessionIds`. The runtime generation advances on bootstrap / reconnect /
runtime switch / dispose; the focus generation advances on every
`focusProject` call so a stale promise cannot commit while a newer folder
focus is already in flight.

### Topic-bus notify contract

`PiSessionStore.subscribe(listener, topic?)` registers a listener on one of
five topic keys; `commitEvents` and other writers publish one notification
per topic they touch so a token delta in session B does not wake session A
chat transcript selectors.

- `session:{id}` — that session's reducer record changed.
- `catalog` — `state.catalog` identity changed.
- `dialogs` — runtime-wide pending extension-dialog membership; only dialog open, dismissal, hydrate, and reconnect reconciliation publish it.
- `chrome` — cluster UI: `connection`, `error`, `directory`,
  `selectedSessionId`, `sessions[]`, `sessionsListStatus`,
  `focusPending`, `hydratedSessionIds`, `sessionLoadErrorById`.
- `*` (default) — broadcast every commit, for tests and legacy callers.

`commitEvents` walks the event batch and collects the session ids whose
reducer record changed; it emits `session:{id}` for each and `catalog`
iff `nextCatalog !== prevCatalog`. Catalog helpers (`applyLifecycleChange`,
`applyHydratedChange`, `markDirectoryLoading`, `markDirectoryFailed`,
`applyDirectoryListToCatalog`, etc.) are reference-stable no-ops, so the
catalog gate is a tight contract. `commitEvents` never emits `chrome` on
the token path. Every other writer that mutates the catalog must capture
`catalogChanged` **before** assigning `state.catalog`; the catalog gate
is `nextCatalog !== this.state.catalog`, and after the assignment the
two are always equal.

Reset / dispose / runtime wipe broadcast the empty state to every topic
bucket so mounted UI sees the reset before the listener sets are torn
down; `dispose` may clear listener sets after the final broadcast.

### Folder switch loading contract

A folder click cannot flash `ChatEmptyState` or an auto-open blank chat.
The chat surface already shows the existing PiChamber logo loader when its
selected id is not yet in `hydratedSessionIds`; `focusPending` extends that
loader preconditions to a folder switch without a known id, and
`sessionsListStatus` lets the chat distinguish loading / ready / failed.
`focusPending` is set the moment a folder click swaps the pointer and clears
only when the selected id becomes hydrated, the focus resolves to an
authoritative empty `sessions[]`, or the focus fails outright. An authoritatively
missing session (`INVALID_SESSION` on hydrate or preferred-id lookup) commits
normal deletion cleanup and navigates away to the next active session (or clears
when none remains) instead of retaining an error page; other load errors
(including `SESSION_IN_USE`) stay selected and land in `sessionLoadErrorById`
so the chat shows "Session could not be loaded" instead of spinning. A missing
deep-linked session that fails for another reason is a per-session load error in
`sessionLoadErrorById`, not `connection: 'error'` and not an infinite
PiChamber logo. The chat's existing "Session could not be loaded" block
covers that id; other chats on the cluster keep working. `ensureSessionRenderable`
must hydrate when the UI id is already selected but not in `hydratedSessionIds`
— a no-op there left stale deep links spinning after `select()` during
`connection: 'loading'` set the pointer without fetching.

Warm folder switches skip the loader: if the preferred session id is already
in `hydratedSessionIds`, `focusProject` selects it immediately and resolves
the list in the background. `PiSessionProvider` seeds `start({directory})`
with the cluster's `lastSelectedSessionForDirectory(directory)` hint so a
warm folder change lands the user on their remembered session with no
spinner. A user-opened draft suppresses raw URL session reapplication and
keeps the Pi selection out of the visible route until a session is
materialized.

### List failure vs empty success

A folder-B list is retried exactly once on transient `DAEMON_UNAVAILABLE`
or 5xx/408/429 before the focus slice flips to
`sessionsListStatus: 'failed'`. Failed focus keeps the cluster, the stream,
the previous folder's transcripts, and the focused `directory` intact; the
chat's existing "Session could not be loaded" block exposes **Try again**,
which re-runs `focusProject`. A successful empty list is the distinct
`'ready'` case with `sessions: []` and no error, so an empty new project can
auto-open its draft without flashing a failure banner.

### First-attach race

`hasClusterAttached()` is `stream !== null || connection === 'ready'`. Once
the cluster enters the `'ready'` window — after the list resolves and
during the SSE-plug window — a project click routes through `focusProject`,
not `start` / `open`. Folder changes during that window do not bump
`runtimeGeneration` and never dispose a soon-to-be-stream. The first-attach
`open()` keeps `connection: 'loading'` while the cluster is genuinely
uninitialized; it flips to `'ready'` once the list resolves, and the chat
surfaces use that flag to gate the loader.

### LRU eviction

Idle transcripts are evicted by a deferred microtask scan after both
`commitHydratedSession` and `commitEvents`. The scan walks resident
sessions by `lastAccessById` (a per-process monotonic clock) in ascending
order and drops the longest-idle until the cluster is at
`PI_TRANSCRIPT_EVICTION_SOFT_CAP` (default 16). Selected, busy/retry, and
pending-prompt sessions are protected; `lastSequence` for evicted sessions
is retained so a later rehydrate resumes from the same cursor. The scan
never runs on the hydrate acquisition path — a render mounting many
entries schedules one scan, not one per entry.

### Reconnect catch-up

`reconnect()` keeps the disconnected stream handle alive while it probes and
fetches a replacement snapshot. If that explicit recovery fails, the stream's
indefinite backoff loop remains the recovery owner instead of being disposed
with its next retry already scheduled. A later healthy transport connection
clears the connection error. If explicit recovery succeeds first, it disposes
the old handle and installs the replacement stream. If the first runtime probe
fails before any normal stream exists, the store attaches a payload-free
recovery stream solely to reuse the transport's online/visibility-aware
backoff. Once that endpoint connects, the store disposes it and reruns the
authoritative bootstrap.

A successful explicit reconnect adopts `runStartedAt`/`serverNow` from the
selected session detail before it merges the snapshot into the existing
cluster. It then iterates any hydrated resident whose `lastSequence` is behind
the resumed cursor, issuing a `getSession` and `commitHydratedSession` for each.
A quiet background turn does not lose the disconnect gap. Accepted
`session.snapshot` events also force-hydrate that session, because a snapshot
means the bounded event log could not replay the disconnect gap.

### `ensureHydrated`

`store.ensureHydrated(id)` hydrates a session if it isn't already resident,
without changing `selectedSessionId` or the directory focus. Chat surfaces
that mount a child session inside a tool part use it instead of `select`,
so background hydrations don't steal the visible chat.

`open(directory, sessionId)` is the first-attach entry: it selects the daemon
project, probes health, lists and hydrates the selected session, and attaches
the runtime-wide stream. The health and list results from that first attach
are passed into hydration rather than probed/listed a second time. After attach, `open`, `start`, project selection, and `setActiveSession` route to
`focusProject(directory)` when the cluster is attached, then call
`select(sessionId)` for the new pointer. Same-folder selects remain pure
pointer changes on the resident cluster. Cross-folder
selects swap the list, change the pointer, and hydrate only the new id if it
wasn't already resident.

A `select(project)` that brings the directory into focus calls
`selectProject` (kept for the daemon focus identity used by `listSessions` and
`createSession`); prompt/abort paths already go through
`activateSession(sessionId)`, so a background run keeps its own cwd even when
the focus pointer leaves its folder.

The chat surface waits on `hydratedSessionIds` before painting a session,
so a cached or event-partial transcript cannot flash thinking-block animations
while `getSession` is still merging. The chat body itself remounts with
`key={sessionId}` so composer drafts and viewport anchors reset to the right
session even when the cluster preserves resident transcripts during a folder
switch.

The global session store separately retains authoritative per-directory snapshots for every added project; switching the active Pi runtime directory must not erase unrelated project sessions. The mounted provider follows the
persisted PiChamber project store; with no project selected it connects the
runtime cluster without adopting the daemon process cwd or the filesystem home
as a visible project, so chrome is `ready` with an empty folder focus instead
of remaining on `loading`. `App.tsx`, `MobileApp.tsx`, and `ElectronMiniChatApp.tsx`
mount `PiSessionProvider` around `MainLayout` / the mobile shell / mini-chat.

`usePiSessionSnapshot` caches by store snapshot identity and does not re-run a
selector that closed over a different session or message id while that snapshot
is unchanged. Chat hooks subscribe to `reducer.bySession` / `hydratedSessionIds`
and look the id up after the snapshot read, so opening session B cannot keep
rendering session A's transcript.
React consumers read `PiSessionStore` through `usePiSessionSnapshot(selector)`.
The selector must return a leaf or a stable per-session record; omitting it
re-renders every subscriber on each accepted event.
The restored web shell bootstraps provider/model config through
`initializeApp()` in `SyncAppEffects`; `useConfigStore.loadProviders()` reads the
Pi provider catalog through `piClient` so the picker can leave the loading state. Selection catalogs (composer, session defaults, small
model, walkthrough model) include only authenticated providers that have
models. Users can hide individual models from those catalogs in Providers
settings; hidden models stay out of pickers. Session default, small-model, and
walkthrough-model pickers live on the Sessions page and use the same picker as
the composer. Providers settings still lists the
full catalog so unconfigured providers can be logged in. Composer chrome does not expose an agent selector.
Chat, sidebar, and composer mutations go through `PiSessionStore` and `/api/pi/*`. Pi assistant projections preserve their owning user-message id end to end because the restored chat renderer groups assistant output into user turns by that identity. A live `assistant.message.start` without `parentId` is a turn Pi began without a user prompt (extension `triggerTurn`, for example async subagent results or a supervisor request); the reducer owns it to the latest user message or displayed extension message (`pi.sendMessage`: it carries text or `details`; an appended entry carries only `data` and never owns a turn), whichever came last, matching the daemon's history projection, because the renderer drops parentless assistant messages. The daemon sends the same owner as an explicit `parentId`, so the fallback only covers older daemons and hydrated history. An explicit `parentId` is never replaced, and no parent is invented when the session has no user message or displayed extension message. In the timeline, an extension message that an assistant message names as its parent heads its own turn (`components/chat/lib/turns/extensionTurnHeads.ts`, used by `projectTurnRecords` and `windowTurns`): the turn renders at that message, so a supervisor request, the reply turn it triggered and the later reply row appear in order. An extension message no assistant names stays an ungrouped row. Tool parts preserve input, cumulative partial output, final output, error text, metadata, and start/end timestamps through the reducer. `pi-to-renderable` keeps that contract for live and expanded tools; settled historical tools whose output or patch exceeds a character budget become preview stubs (`state.deferredBody`) so transcript records do not retain full bodies. Expanding a tool hydrates the canonical part through `useSessionReducerPart`. A completed tool needs an end time and keeps its status verbatim, including `cancelled`. `pi-to-renderable` also copies the producing `providerId`/`modelId` onto both nested `info.model` and top-level `info.providerID`/`info.modelID` so the assistant message footer can show the model name without guessing from the current composer selection.
Settings chrome is the restored PiChamber hub limited to Pi-owned pages
(Providers, Skills, Snippets, Prompt templates, Behavior/`AGENTS.md`, appearance, and other
PiChamber pages). A failed daemon probe must show an error banner,
never an empty idle session list.

Native resource discovery is projected from Pi's resource loader without filesystem paths. Skills are browse-only; Pi prompt templates and applicable global/project instruction files are edited only through opaque daemon identifiers with explicit effective directories. Only editable top-level global/project prompts expose mutation controls; package/path prompts stay visible but read-only. Project-local resources remain hidden until the browser makes an explicit persisted Pi trust decision; project prompt mutations additionally require that trust and fail as `PROJECT_UNTRUSTED` otherwise. Extensions remain disabled by the daemon.

Provider discovery is projected from Pi's model runtime without credentials.
The mounted Providers surface submits API keys once through the authenticated
adapter or renders Pi's opaque browser/device/manual-code login state; stored
credentials never return to the browser. Custom providers are written through the same adapter to Pi `models.json`; onboarding requires an explicit Pi API format (`openai-completions`, `openai-responses`, `anthropic-messages`, or `google-generative-ai`) and defaults new forms to OpenAI Chat Completions. Each onboarding model has the same omission-preserving options as manual model addition: display name, token limits, input modalities, thinking support, and thinking-level values. Configuration responses expose only those supported model fields. Provider edits preserve unexposed existing model metadata server-side rather than round-tripping it through the browser. Whole-provider
replacement stays on `PUT /api/pi/providers/:id/models` (`piClient.setProviderModels`,
daemon `providers.models.set`, unchanged). Single-model append uses
`POST /api/pi/providers/:id/models` (`piClient.addProviderModel`, daemon
`providers.models.add`): the client sends `{ id, name?, reasoning?, thinkingLevelMap?, input?, contextWindow?, maxTokens? }`. The UI provides field-level validation, while the model configuration store is authoritative for normalization and validation. The daemon rejects unavailable, duplicate, ambiguous, or extension-owned providers, seeds missing file providers only from authoritative live metadata, and delegates model validation and atomic persistence to the store. Existing providers, models, and unexposed metadata remain untouched. The initialized composer reuses its authoritative config snapshot when it creates a session with an explicit model, including the per-model thinking default. Callers that run before config initialization or omit the model still fetch `/api/pi/settings`, preserving the authoritative fallback and failure contract without putting an extra settings round trip on the normal send path. PiChamber new-session model, small-model, and walkthrough-model
defaults live in its own sidecar and are edited on the Sessions settings page with the shared model picker. The authenticated `/api/pi/small-model/generate` adapter uses an isolated in-memory Pi session with the configured small model (falling back to the configured default model) for short utility output. It replaces Pi's coding-agent system prompt with a stateless text-transformation prompt and disables tools, extensions, skills, prompt templates, and context files, so task text is input data rather than an instruction to inspect or modify the repository. It never writes a visible session or JSONL file, applies a bounded timeout, and returns no provider, credential, prompt, or daemon metadata. Worktree naming is its first consumer. It accepts generated text only when the complete response is already a lowercase ASCII hyphenated slug within the 48-character limit; prose, prefixes, punctuation, and overlong output fall back to a deterministic local slug derived from the task prompt. Generation failure uses the same fallback. Per-model thinking variants live solely in
Providers settings — each model row shows its default variant directly
without a boxed border (`Default` when unset) and stores `pichamber.defaultThinkingByModel`
(`provider/model` → level). The Sessions default-thinking row edits the same
map entry for the current default model. All are applied on session create and
composer model changes, clamped to that model’s Pi `thinkingLevels`. A leftover
global `defaultThinking` is only a clamp fallback when no default model is set.
Providers owns authentication, catalog, manual model addition, and per-model variant defaults; Sessions
owns new-session model selection. Manual models are added from the Available Models header: the dialog keeps only Model ID visible and puts Display name plus the user-configurable optional fields (context window, max output tokens, input modalities, reasoning, and newline-separated thinking values requiring Supports thinking) under a conditionally rendered Advanced settings disclosure with Pi defaults shown as placeholders while empty inputs stay omitted. The UI validates supported fields, disables thinking values until Supports thinking is enabled, submits through `piClient.addProviderModel`, refreshes the authoritative catalog, and reports deferred activation. `providers.list` projects
Pi `getSupportedThinkingLevels` (`off` through `max`, with `xhigh`/`max`
opt-in and `null` map entries hidden). Only the explicit new-session
overrides are passed to the daemon, so Pi's normal settings fallback remains
authoritative otherwise. Composer thinking next to the model name is driven
from catalog `thinkingLevels` (hidden when the model only offers `off`).
Choosing a level updates the composer override immediately and does not
call `sessions.setThinking`. Unset/Default does not invent a level. Opening
an existing session restores the composer to that session's last used model
and thinking (latest assistant turn, then live `session.model` /
`session.thinking`) instead of the globally last-selected model. Manual
composer changes stay pending until send: `routeMessage` applies model then
thinking, then prompts, so extensions that key off the committed triple see
it on that turn. A failed apply aborts the send instead of prompting with
the previous session selection. Slash commands, the Pi TUI, and other tabs
still mutate the live session immediately; the composer adopts those
authoritative changes. Existing session thinking stays until the user sends
a new selection or an external command changes it.
Composer attachments are uploaded before prompt dispatch and the returned opaque identifiers are forwarded with that captured send. Because Pi's live user start can precede the branch-readable transcript entry, that start also carries bounded filename and MIME metadata as `file` parts. The reducer renders those parts immediately and later hydration replaces them with the authoritative persisted projection. Attachment uploads return opaque identifiers; their temporary paths cross only
the private daemon IPC and are redacted from public transcript/event output.
The browser never receives a path, endpoint, credential, or daemon identity.
